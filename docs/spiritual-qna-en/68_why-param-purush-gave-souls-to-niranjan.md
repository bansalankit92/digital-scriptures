Niranjan Meditated on Param Purush for a pe- riod of 204 Yugas. Param Purush was pleased with his hard worship and asked him to ask for what he wanted. Niranjan prayed to Him to either give him the whole of Amarlok or give him some separate abode. It was only then that Param Purush asked him to create 3 Lokas in Shunya and rule over it. As he had no Jiva to rule over, he Prayed Param Purush to hand over some souls to him. Under the sway of devotion, He created Adhya Shakti and handing over countless Souls to her, asked her to help Niranjan in giving birth to a real creation. He did not ask them to imprison the Souls in bodily cages. Nevertheless, Niranjan, along with Maya, didnâ€™t care for it and instead, put the Souls in bodily cages thus preventing their escape to Amarlok.  
Had Niranjan not put the Souls in the Mayaic cages, the Souls would have returned to Sat Lok as and when they desired and also they would have saved themselves from any torture. So it is clear that Param Purush had no hand in all this. Niranjan committed all sorts of bad acts and proved himself to be a bad and disobedient son.
