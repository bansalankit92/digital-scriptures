There are 5 material elements in the human body. It has the greatest amount of Consciousness in it. Man has the power to remember a great many things. This body is full of knowledge. If one were lucky enough to attain the human body repeatedly, one could remember the past lives and taking the world as an abode of sufferings and sorrows, one would have thought of attaining Salvation. It is on account of its passing through different Yonis, that the Jiva forgets everything related to its past lives. Other Yonis have no element of knowledge.
