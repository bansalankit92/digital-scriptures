The 11th dwara lies within the Surti. It can’t be opened through any Yog, Yagya, hard worship and the like. This is because the practices like Yog can help only in awakening our cell centers and have no role in the awakening of our Soul. That is why it can be performed by a perfect Guru alone. At the time of blessing with Naam, he separates the Surti from the Mind and creates awakening in it. This grace makes the task easy for the devotee.
