Many devotees have experienced that whenever they begin to indulge in some wrong act even unknowingly or whenever they are about to meet some accident, some hidden power comes to their rescue. This hidden power is nothing but the power of "Naam" about which I have repeatedly said—

Guru Sajeevan Naam Bataye.
Jakey Bal Hansa Ghar Jaye.
Kag Palat Hansa Ker Deena.
Aisa Purush Naam Main Deena.
```

Satguru reveals the rare Alive 'Naam' that has the power to take a Hansa to its original abode Amarlok, and it transform the crow like mind in to that of a celestial Swan

### "The Thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in this universe"   -- Satguru Madhu Paramhans Sahib.

Kal Niranjan is the fifth son of Param Purush, born out of word. He is known as Nirakar Niranjan, Adi Narayan, Adi Shiv, Adi Brahman and Mind etc. This world addresses him as Rama, Brahma, Shiva, and also remaind him as Niranjan, Kadar, Kareem, Parameshwar, Paramatma, Hari, Non dual and Alak Niranjan etc. This Niranjan is given thousand names in Religious Scriptures.

Duniya Jisko ‘Paramatma’ Maaney,  
Sohi ‘Kaal’ Koi Bheid Na Jaaney.
  -- Sant Kabir
```

The ‘Power’ who is ruling over the universe, whom the whole world considers and worship, as ‘God’; is no one else but ‘Kaal Purush’ (God of Death/Mind/Mann). This secret is unknown to the whole of humanity.
