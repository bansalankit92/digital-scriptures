The Sant Satguru have a treasure of spiritual powers that are very much needed by our soul. None can attain this treasure without the blessings of the Satguru. When we go to the Sant Satgurus, we receive this energy in three ways (Dharsan, Sparshan and Sambhasan). Firstly, when they look at us, we receive the spiritual energy present in their eyes. That is why we request them to have their gracious look at us. Secondly, we receive this energy through their words. That is why great significance is attached to Sat Sangs.

Dhanya Ghari Jab Ho Satsang  
```  
Blessed is the moment when one happens to attend  
the Satsang.  
Thirdly, we receive this energy through touch.  
However, out of respect it is advised to touch the feet only.  
That is why so much significance is attached to the auspicious sight-Dharsan of the Satguru. We should continue to have their holy vision when they happen to be near us.

Keyi Baar Na Hoyi Sake, Doyi Vakat Ker Leyi  
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Kaaldaga Nehin Deyi  
```  
If you can’t find time to have the vision many times a day, you can do so at least twice a day. It will make you safe from the onslaught of Kaal.  
```text  
Doye Vakat Ne Ho Sakey, Din Mein Karey Ik Bar  
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Utre Bhavjal Par  
```  
If you can’t do so twice a day, you can do so at least once a day. A devotee who sights the holy vision of the Satguru, crosses the worldly ocean.  
```text  
Ek Din Na Kari Sakey, Dooje Din Kari Le  
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Pavey Uttam Deh.  
```  
If you are not in a position to have his Dharsan once a day, you can do so the next day.  
This is just like the case of our body that grows somewhat weak if we don’t take the food for the whole day. However, our weakness gets removed when we take the food the next day.  
```text  
Dooje Din Na Kari Sakey, Chauthe Din Ker Jaye  
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Moksh Mukti Phall Paye  
```  
You can have the vision on the fourth day if you are not in a position to do so on the second day. A devotee who does so, attains salvation.  
The energy received from the Satguru even on the 4th day would prevent the Mind from gaining control over the soul.  
```text  
Mata Pita Sut Istri, Bandhu Kutumb Ko Jaan.  
Gurudarshan Ko Jabb Chaley, Yeh Atkave Aan.  
Unka Atka Na Rahey, Guru Darshan Ko Jaye.  
Kahai Kabir So Sant Jann, Moksh Mukti Phall Paye.  
```  
The parents, Son, Wife and other relations will cause hindrance in the path when the devotee desires to go for having the Dharsan of Satguru. Sahib Kabir says that the devotee shouldn’t stop and should proceed on his way. Such a devotee is sure to attain salvation.  
Just as a tree derives all the needed energy from the earth but still it needs one kind of energy. This energy is that of the Sun. In the same manner, one may achieve as many miraculous powers through Yogic and other such like practices as one likes, but he can’t cross the worldly ocean on the basis of these very powers alone. For this, he will have to receive the spiritual energy from the Satguru.  
The Naam blessed by the Satguru is the basis of spiritual power. The Jeeva can’t cross the worldly ocean of life and death without it. The vision of the Guru makes this energy grow. We can receive this energy through meditation as well. However, more amount of energy can be received when the Guru is very much present before us. Meditation is done only as an alternative to vision. During meditation, we try to fix the form of the Guru. However, we can receive this energy directly when the Guru is before our eyes. As such, we should not close our eyes when we find the Guru before us. There is no need to do meditation at that time.

Vaar Vaar Na Kari Sake, Pakshe Paksh Karey Soye  
Kahai Kabir Ta Dass Ka, Janam Safal Ho Jaye  
```  
He who is not in a position to have the vision once a week, can do so once in every fortnight. It will make his life purposeful.  
```text  
Pakshe Paksh Na Kari Sakey, Maas Maas Karu Jaye,  
Ya Mein Dair Na Laiye, Kahain Kabir Samujhaye  
```  
If the disciple finds it difficult to have the vision once in a fortnight, he can do so once a month. He shouldn’t make any delay in doing so.  
```text  
Maas Maas Na Kari Sakey, Chhate Maas Albatt  
Ya Mein Dheel Na Kijiye, Kahain Kabir Avigatt  
```  
If due to some unavoidable circumstances the devotee is not able to go for having the vision of Satguru once a month even, he can do so at least once in every six month. Sahib Kabir says that he shouldn’t show any laziness in this regard.  
Any laziness in this regard would make the Mind gain dominance over the Soul and the Individual will begin to do many sorts of wrong acts.  
```text  
Chhate Maas Na Kari Sakey, Baras Dina Kari Lehi  
Kahai Kabir So Sant Jann, Yamhin Chunauti Dehi  
```  
If some devotee is not in a position to have the vi- sion of his Guru even once in six months, he should do so once a year at least. If he does so, he can pose a challenge to the Yama as well. That is to say, he can attain salvation. However, the devotee who fails to do even this much, is a very unlucky, indeed. He shouldn’t hope to attain salvation.
