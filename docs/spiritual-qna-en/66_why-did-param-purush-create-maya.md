At first Param Purush was all alone. When he created Mind, a bit of that element remained behind. In normal life as well, we find that even after cleaning a dirty place, some of the dirt is still left behind. In the same manner, Param Purush removed from within Him the traces of dirt that were left behind after the creation of Mind. It was that dirt which appeared in the form of girl and it is the same Maya that has given birth to the whole of world (Biodiversity).
