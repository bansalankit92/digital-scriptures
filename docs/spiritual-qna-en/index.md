### Shri Satguru Ve Namah


<div align="center">

```
Bhakti-Bhakti Sab Jagat Bakhana
Bhakti Bheid Koi Virla Jaana
```
The whole world is worshiping God in their own ways.
But, only the rare being knows about the real secret
behind the true worship of Supreme Lord
```
Andhe Kho Andha Miley Toh Rah Batavey Khon|
Bandhe Kho Bandha Miley Toh Ghaat Chudavey Khon||
```
How can a Blind man lead another Blind.
How can one who himself is under bondage free another.
