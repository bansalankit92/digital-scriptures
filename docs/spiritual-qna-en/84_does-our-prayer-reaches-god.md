All the prayers made by the worldly people reach Niranjan alone. All the problems related to the body have nothing to do with Param Purush. They are related to Niranjan alone. That Niranjan gives all the things to the people so that they may take him as the real God who hears their prayers, by default. He will give only the material things and in no case he would give the knowledge of the Soul.  
Let me tell you some facts about Nichiketa. His father was a king. He wanted to give an old cow in charity. He didn’t like the idea. He thought that one should give only some fine things in charity. He asked his father whom he would give him in charity. The father didn’t pay any heed to what he said. Nichiketa repeated her question but the king paid no heed to it. However, when he continued to repeat his question, his father said that he will give him in charity to death. He went to Chitar Gupat. Yamraj told him that he was a just king and had mistakenly come there. He told him that he was much pleased with him and asked what he wanted. The king said that he wanted Spiritual knowledge. Yam Raj asked him not to ask for that. He said that he was prepared to give him anything else he wanted.  
I mean to say, knowingly or unknowingly, we don’t succeed in making our prayer heard by the real God. Instead, it reaches Niranjan, the ruler of the 3 Worlds who doesn’t bother about our welfare. He doesn’t want to reveal the real Spiritual knowledge.
