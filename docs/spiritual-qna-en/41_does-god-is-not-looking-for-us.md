No, all of us are in the hands of Niranjan who labored hard for 204 Yugas to get blessed with the rulership of 17 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas ( over the 3 Lokas. Though he is the Son of Param Purush, yet he has turned out to be a dirty Son. Just as you turn out your Son and even sever relations with him if he stops behaving as a dutiful Son, in the same manner, Param Purush ousted His Son Niranjan from Amarlok on account of his evil and wrong deeds. Nevertheless, he had got blessed with the rule over the 3 Lokas and also had got the Souls as well.  
Now he has been torturing the Souls of Param Purush by imprisoning them in the bodily cages.  
The Salvation the world has been talking about is nothing but Salvation from the imprisonment of Niranjan. A little thought will enable you know that you are not under the care of the real God. Had it been so, you wouldnâ€™t have to suffer from so much tortures. None can even think of giving so many tortures to his children.

The Soul is entrapped in the net of Karmas. It has no  
concern with any of the Karma, and nothing to gain or  
lose in this moral world.
