 None can do any harm to the disciple. None has ever said that earlier he was the worshiper of Hanuman Ji and now after taking to the worship of Param Purush (Sahib ), Hanuman Ji had come to attack him with his Guraj ( the metal weapon he carries with him ). None of the followers of other deities has ever complained of any such thing.

Devi Deva Jagat Mein, Kotin Pooje Koye  
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sub Ki Pooja Hoye.  
```  
There are crores of Gods and the Goddesses in the universe. Nevertheless, the fact remains that in the worship of the Satguru lies the worship of all.  
There was a grain of rice in the house of Draupdi. She offered the same to Krishan Ji. All the Rishi Munies felt they had no more appetite. Otherwise, there was not sufficient food in her house to satisfy the hunger of all. This was the miracle of Guru. Life is short and even countless births will appear less if one remains entangled in bringing all the deities round. In such a case when will one attempt to seek Salvation? In the worship of the Satguru lies the worship of the whole of Brahmand. Remember! All the Gods and the Goddesses even bow before the worshiper of a Satguru. You might have watched in TV the Gods and the Goddesses offering flowers to the true worshipers in a graceful manner. Frightening others in the name of the Gods and the Goddesses has become the job of selfish persons.  
A goat lost its way in a forest. It could fall a prey to any beasts of prey. It went straightway to the lion and said that it was in his shelter. The lion agreed to it and said that none would dare to do any harm to it.  
The lion called his ministers including the bear and the like and asked them to make an announcement in the forest that the goat belonged to the lion and as such, none should dare to touch it. Now the goat began to graze in the forest in a carefree manner. In the same manner, none would dare to do any harm the one who worships Param Purush.  
We are not against any Religious Scripture. The Shastras present all that is related to Niranjan. The Vedas sayâ€”

Dheyan Moolam Guru Roopam,  
Pooja Moolam Guru Padkam  
Manter Moolam Guru Vakyam,  
Moksh Moolam Guru.  
```  
Fix concentration at the appearance of the Guru,  
worship his feet, Take the words of the Guru as Mantra,  
and his very grace as Salvation.

Teen Lok Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koi.  
Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.  
Satguru Deen Dayal Ji, Tum Lag Meri Daud.  
Jaise Kaag Jahaj Par, Sujhat Aur Na Thaur.  
```  
Satguru will not direct you to work on spiritual exercises, Sadhanas. Satguru is a compassasnate Savior and Guide who help you cross this worldly Ocean of Life. There is none, who equals him in these three worlds
