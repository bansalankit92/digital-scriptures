Whenever Niranjan causes great dissolution, the whole of Brahmand gets destroyed. He absorbs all the planets within him. Nothing like heaven, Pitar Lok and the like is left behind. Then , taking all the Souls with him, he goes near the Amarlok. He canâ€™t enter it. He prays to Param Purush to take back all the souls saying he is not interested in creating the universe again.  
He receives the order to create the universe again as he received the boon for the same. As such, he goes on creating repeatedly. When the universe is created again, it is the air that appears first. Then, fire from the air, water from the fire and finally earth is created out of water. This process of creation and destruction goes on.
