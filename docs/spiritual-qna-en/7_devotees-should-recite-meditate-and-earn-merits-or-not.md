I have never said that the devotees should perform rites, rituals and other kinds of deeds to the extent they can, so that based on these they can cross the worldly ocean.  
I have 2 mobiles. I receive many phone calls. The  
people phone me even during night hours.  
I switch off my phones before going to bed. One day, I forgot to switch off one mobile. At about 1:30, I received a phone call. At first I thought of not attending to it but then I thought it might be of some urgent nature. When I attended it, the fellow on phone, after saying Sahib Bandgi, said that he was Lakhvinder. I asked what a time he had chosen. He said that he had been trying for quite a long time but was not receiving any response. I asked what he wanted to say. He said that he was an employee in some factory and after reaching home he felt so much tired that he found it difficult to sit in meditation.  
I asked him to do so even while moving about. He said that he couldn’t remember even that much as he had to work for about 15 hours. He wanted to know whether he would be able to cross the worldly ocean or would see his precious life going waste. I advised him to follow the principles laid down for the Naamis in right earnest. He said that he had been doing that much with full devotion. I said that he should rest assured that he will cross the worldly ocean. He asked why I asked the Naamis to sit in meditation and recite the holy Naam. What was the difference between those who did so and those like him who didn’t do so? I said that he would cross the worldly ocean receiving the pains of drowning while the others would straightway cross. Now it was up to him to decide as to how he would like to go across. Sahib Kabir has said—

Sumiran Se Sukh Hoat Hai, Sumiran Se Dukh Jaye  
Kahein Kabir Sumiran Kiye, Sain Mahin Samaye  
```
Recitation of Naam removes the sorrows and brings joys and also enables the devotee to get absorbed in Param Purush.  
Sahib Kabir further says—  
```text  
Naam Na Liya To Keya Bheya, Jo Under Hai Hait  
Pativrata Pati Ko Bhaje, Kabhoon Naam Na Lait  
```  
What then if one fails to recite the Naam? A lady,  
devoted to her husband, worships him even without  
speaking his name  
The fact is that—  
```text  
Merey Hari Mauko Bhajein, Main Sovun Panv Pasar  
```  
My God recites my name while I enjoy a peaceful  
sleep.  
Keep safe that which I have given to you. The Satguru has enabled you cross the worldly ocean. Remember! If you don’t recite the Naam, the Mind will try to entangle you in the world. Anyhow, you need not bother like others about earning of merit-Punya.  
```text  
Satya Naam Nij Aushdi, Satguru Dei Bataye  
```  
The Satguru has told you about the herb in the form  
of the real Naam.  
So if you don’t recite the holy Naam, make sure you don’t fall in the grip of Mind. I explain everything at the time of blessing with Naam. I have done within moments that which couldn’t be done even after spending years together in caves.  
```text  
Koti Janam Ka Patth Tha Guru Pall Mein Diya Pahunchae  
```  
The Guru helped in covering within moments the path that couldn’t be covered in even countless births.  
Others talk of making earnings whereas I talk of keeping safe the wealth I have given to you. You will find all your tasks getting accomplished in an unbelievable manner. It is your duty to make others as well have a knowledge of all this. Your worldly attachment will go on fading and the Mind will, so to say, salute you. You can fix your concentration at anything you like. You will find everything well in your control. Believe me, even while in family, you are living the life of a sage.  
```text  
Jo Koyi Kahey Ki Main Kiya To Dhani Sahey Ga Maar  
```  
He who boasts of having accomplished on his own,  
will receive the unbearable thrashing.

Those who have the grace of Satguru escape from this and reaches their true home Amarlok with the help of Naam.

Guru Sajeevan Naam bataey,jaakay bal Hansa ghar jaaey.  
```  
A Perfect Spiritual Master Satguru when transmits the  
Supreme Power into an individual through His paras surati  
concentration, after then only an individual’s soul will  
reach back to its true abode, Amarlok.

Guru Govind Dou Khade, Kake Lagun Paye.  
Balihari Guru Aapno, Jin Govind Diyo Bataye.  
```  
Guru was equaled to God before Sants. Our Holy Scriptures  
and sages have given even equal status to Guru and God.  
However Sants brought a revolution in the spiritual field. They  
placed Satguru even above God.
