## Sant Samrat Kabir Sahib (1398-1518)

In the year 1398, Sahib Kabir, the founder of Spiritualism, appeared in the Lahar Tara pond of Kashi, in the early hours of the full moon day of Monday. No other sage has so many misconceptions attached to him as have been attached to Sahib Kabir regarding his birth. Some described him as the offspring of an unmarried lady; some described him as the offspring of a low caste lady while others coined other unbelievable stories about him. Even today his birth has been a sort of riddle for the worldly people although he has himself revealed the secret related to his birth in his own words.
He has said—

Santo Avigat Se Hum Aye, Koyi Bhed Bharam Na Paye
Na Hum Rahle Garab Vas Mein, Balak Hoyi Dikhlaya
Kashi Tatt Srovar Bheetar, Tahan Julaha Paya
Na Hamre Bhai Bandhu Hain,Na Sung Girhi Dassi
Neeru Ke Ghar Nam Dharaye, Jug Mein Ho Geyi Hasi
Aane Takiya Ung Hamari,Ajaramar Pur Dera
Hukam Haisiyat Se Chaley Aye, Katan Yam Ka Phera
Kashi Mein Hum Prakat Huye,Ramanand Per Dhaya
Kahai Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Hans Chetavan Aya
```
I have come from an unknown place. None could know the secret related to me. Without staying in the womb of the mother, I appeared as a child. A weaver found me in the pond of Kashi. Neither I have any relations nor any wife.     
Getting a name in the house of Neeru made me a laughing stock in the world. My abode is in Amarlok. I have come here to save the Jivas-Humans from the grip of Yamas- Lord of death. I appeared in Kashi and got blessed with Naam from Ramanand. Listen to me and think over what I say. I have come to create awakening among the Humans.  


At many places Sahib Kabir has revealed many secrets related to him. These leave no doubt in the minds of the readers that he appeared on this earth not from the womb of the mother but from the rare and dazzling light of Param Purush of Amarlok. Dear readers, I don’t intend to give rise to any unnecessary discussion or to create any misconception in the minds of the people.  
I have only tried to present before you a great truth.  
The word Kabir has in it the entire truth about Sahib Kabir.  
```text
'Kakka Kewal Nam Hai, Babba Baran Sharir'
R-Ra Sub Mein Rum Raha, Jis Ka Nam Kabir
Gagan Mandal Se Utre, Satguru Satya Kabir
Jagg Manhi Paudan Kiya, Sub Peeron Ke Peer
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye
Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Usko Kaal Na Khaye
```
Recitation by mouth as well as the inward recitation perish away. But it is the Surti (present in Naam itself) that can’t be destroyed by Kaal.  
Musical notes are present within us. Some get absorbed in them. Some take these very notes as God itself. But one can’t move beyond the limit of Turiateet ( State of Maha Yogeswars-Trinity) on the basis of these. The notes perish away. Then what kind of word can we call these? That is to say, we can’t take Dhunatmic (Sounds) word as well as the Varanatmic (Syllable) word as the real Naam.  
Sahib Kabir says—  
```text
So To Shabad Vidhey.  
```
That word is Muktatmic, that is to say, it is nothing but a soundless sound.  
```text
Do Bin Hoye Na Awaz
```
Sound can be produced only when two objects strike and where there is sound, there is Maya.  
```text
Hadd Tappe So Auliya, Be-Hadd Tappe To Peer.
Had Be-Hadd Dono Tappe, Tiska Nam Kabir.
```

He who crosses the limit is taken as an Auliya and he who crosses the limitless is taken as a peer (a great sage) but one who goes beyond both of these is none else but Sahib Kabir.  
All the spiritually enlightened sages of the earlier times agreed to his views in letter and spirit. He presented in a simple way the means that could help the devotees worship the real God (Param Purush) even while leading a family life. He revealed in the language of the common masses the ways and means to open the Sushumna nerve.  
The holy Nam he has talked about has the power to take the devotee in the pure spiritual world. A very high place has been given to the sayings of Sahib Kabir in the holy Granth Sahib. Dadu Dayal Ji has shown his regard for Sahib Kabir in his own way. He says—  
```text
Kete Santa Koop Hai, Kete Sarita Neer
Dadu Agam Athah Hai, Dariya Satya Kabir
Satya Kabir Is Like A Limitless River.
He Resides Within The Hearts Of All.
Bani Arab Va Kharablaun,Granthan Koti Hazar
Karta Purush Kabir Hai, Nabhe Kiya Vichar
```
The Sant Nabha Ji says that one may study countless sayings and thousands of religious scriptures but the fact remains that it is Satya Kabir alone who is the doer.  
Dadu Dayal Ji says—
```text
Dadu Naam Kabir Ka, Jo Koyi Leve Oat
Usko Kabhi Na Lagsi, Kaal Bazar Ki Choat
```
He who gets blessed with the holy Naam of Sahib Kabir, remains safe from the attack of Kaal.  
Gareeb Dass Ji says—
```text
Gagan Mandal Se Utre, Sahib Purush Kabir
Chola Dhara Khavas Ka, Torey Yam Janjeer
```
Sahib Kabir has descended on the earth in the guise of a Sevak to free the Jivas from the chains of Yama.  

Guru Nanak Dev Ji too held Kabir Sahib in high esteem. He has described him as a flawless Sant Samrat who is the real well wisher and savior of the humanity.  

These words of the holy Sants leave no doubt in the minds of the devotees about the fact that Sahib Kabir was not a human being. Normally everyone sings the glory of his own deity-God, but there is some reality and depth in what I have said. You should think over it in an impartial manner  

All of you know that he appeared on this universe on the Jyesht Sudhi Poornima of the year 1 398. After spreading the message of true and real form of worship for a period of 120 years, he decided to go to his real abode in Amarlok.  

As such, at the time of his departure he thought of revealing to the world his real identity. He did so to remove the misconceptions that had been created by the vested interests regarding his birth. He declared that he would depart from the world on Magh Sudhi Ekadsi (a particular day of the particular month) of the year 15 18 at Maggar ( near Gorakh Pur ). Hearing this declaration Lakhs of people gathered there. Among them there were Veer Singh Baghel, the king of Kashi and Nawab Bijli khan of Awadh. Both of them were the disciples of Sahib Kabir. They came along with their selected army men. Apart from them, a large number of disciples of Sahib Kabir and the common people came there. Many of them had come there simply to watch the miraculous happening.  

Veer Singh Baghel ordered his army chief to be prepared to take the dead body of Sahib Kabir to Kashi where he would erect a Samadhi after performing the last rites. When Bijli Khan came to know of it, he said that he won’t allow such a thing to happen. Sahib Kabir was his Guru and he would erect a Mazar (tomb) after performing his last rites as per his religion. Veer Singh reminded him that Sahib advocated vegetarianism, that it will send wrong message.

Mansahari Manva, Pratayaksh Rakshas Jan.
Taki Sangat Na Karo, Hoye Bhakti Mein Hani.
```
Both of them drew their swords and were prepared to have a fight. In the meantime, a miracle occurred. A rare kind of light appeared in the sky and there was a word which said —  
```text
Uthao Parda Nehin Hai Murda.
E-Murakh Nadana Tum Ne Hum Ko Nehin Pahchana
```
"O fools! You have failed to recognize me. Remove the sheet of cloth and see for yourself, there is no dead body underneath".

When the sheet was removed, there appeared no dead body. Only some lotus flowers were found. Sahib Kabir performed this miracle in the presence of Lakhs of people. The Hindus took the flowers and erected a Samadhi whereas the Muslims took the sheet of cloth and erected a Mazar. These two memorials stand there even today and bear witness to the fact that Sahib Kabir was not a human being. He was , in fact, Param Purush Himself.    

Give a serious thought to what I have said and see how much truth is hidden in it. Prior to it, none in this universe entered without a mother and departed without leaving his body. This was the first and the last kind of miracle that Sahib Kabir showed to the worldly people. His sayings would continue to guide the people about the ways and means that can help them in reaching their original home, Amarlok. The eternal indestructible 4th world.

His philosophy and Ideology can help a lot in establishing peace all over the world now.
```text
Satya Sahib Kabir They, Kah Gaye Sant Sabhi
```
All the Sants have declared in one voice that Sahib Kabir was nothing but truth and truth alone.  
Ravi Dass Ji says—
```text
Swami! Jo Tum Gavo So Hi Gavun, Tumhara Geyan Vicharun
Kahain Rai Dass Suno Ho Swami, Bharam Karam Sub Chadun
```
Leaving all kinds of rites and superstitions, I would believe only in that which you say. Nabha Dass Ji says—  
```text
Pani Te Paida Nehin, Swasa Nehin Sharir
Ann Ahar Kerta Nehin, Tako Nam Kabir
```
He hasn’t been created out of water and doesn’t have a body that breathes. He doesn’t take any food even. That Sant Samrat is none else but Kabir.  
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has described him as the first ever Sant of the world who spread the real form of worship ( related to Param Purush ) all over the world.  
```text
Amli Ho Ker Dharey Dheyan, Girhi Ho Ker Kathe Geyan
Sadhu Ho Ker Koote Bhagg, Kahe Kabir Yeh Teeno Thug
```
Sahib Kabir asks the devotees to take all the three —  

1. One who consumes drugs and sits in meditation.
2. A family holder who recites Kathas ( religious
   discourses ). and
3. A sage who indulges in sexual activities —as
   cheats who misleads.

There are number of Sants in the world today, but none talks of any other authority that lies beyond the Vedas & the Scriptures. Sant Samrat Kabir Sahib has clearly said—
```text
Ved Hamara Bheid Hain, Hum Vedan Ke Mahin.
Jaun Bheid Mein Main Bason, Vedbhi Janat Nahin.
```
Sant Kabir Sahib says that the Vedas &scriptures have in them the secrets of all of us, but even they can’t tell about the secret of my abode.
```text
Iske Aage Bhed Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Jananhara.
Kahein Kabir Janey Ga Soyi, Ja Per Daya Satguru Ki Hoyi.
```
Sant Kabir Sahib says that his mystery is far beyond the limits of Niranjan. Only such a devotee as has the blessings of a Satguru with him, can know it.
