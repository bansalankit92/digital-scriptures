 Yog is just like the Bhog (satisfaction of the organs). Just as a Bhogi derives pleasures related to the 5 Indrias (sense organs), in the same manner, a Yogi derives the pleasures after fixing his concentration at 5 different places. This pleasure is related to the subtle tissues/cells. However, these pleasures are about a thousand times greater than those derived through Bhog. The pleasure in Bhog is related to a particular organ whereas the pleasure in Yog is related to the 10th Dwara.  
A great difference between the Yog Matt and the Sant Matt is that the Yogi can move out of the 10th Dwara and can wander in the abode of Niranjan's worlds but he remains within his limits. He takes the abode of Niranjan as Sat Lok. On the other hand, a Sant moves out of the 11th Dwara after breaking the barriers of Niranjan and reaches the real Sat Lok (Amarlok). This 11th Dwara lies within our Surti itself.

Nau Dware Sansar Sub, Dasvein Yogi Sadh  
Ekadish Khidki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan.  
Dasvein Dwar Se Jeev Jub Jayi, Swarg Lok Mein Basa Payi.  
Geyarvein Dwar Se Pran Nikasa, Amarlok Mein Paye Basa.  
```  
In Yog Matt the Naam is related to the body. That is to say, it is given to the perishable body by the perishable body of the Guru. On the other hand, the Sajeevan Naam blessed in Sant Matt it not related to the body. That is to say, the Satguru blesses this Naam through his Surti into the Surti of the devotee.  
That is why the Satguru at first catches hold of the Surti of the disciple by keeping his hand over his head and then after separating it from the Mind, he blesses the Soul bypassing Mind with his Surti. In Yog Matt, the act of blessing with Naam is done by recitation because it has nothing to do with the Surti. The disciple listens to these words with his ears and begins to recite the same. Such a Naam can be written and read-out. However, the Naam blessed in Sant Matt has nothing to do with the spoken words. The Yogis fix their concentration through Chachri, Bhuchri, Agochri, Unmuni and the Khechri Mudras that are directly linked to the body centres.  
In the Sant Matt the concentration is fixed at a height  
of one and one fourth of a hand above the head. Out side  
Body-Maya.

Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye  
Surti Smani Shabad Mein, Vako Kaal Na Khaye  
```  
Recitation by mouth and inward recitation will perish but the Kaal wonâ€™t be able to destroy the Surti that is present in the Naam itself. The Naam the Sant Matt talks about is nothing but the Soundless Sound. There are no audiable sounds or the musical notes to be found.  
In Yog Matt the disciple has to make earnings- through meriterious actions, while in Sant Matt the disciple gets everything simply by the grace of the Satguru. Unlike the Yog Matt, in Sant Matt the act of creating awakening in the Surti is performed. In Yog Matt, much importance is not attached to the Guru whereas in Sant Matt the Satguru is the sole doer.  
Moreover, in Yog Matt the Meen and the Papeel modes of sadhana are practiced while in Sant Matt it is the flight-Vihangam mode that is followed to reach Amarlok.

Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chal Hamari.  
```  
Sahib Kabir says that he follows the Vihangam mode. Through Yogic practices a devotee can attain many kinds of miraculous powers but he fails to attain the spiritual knowledge. Many Yogis on attaining these powers become egotists as well. However, in Sant Matt, the ego vanishes on attaining the spiritual knowledge. In Yog Matt it is Niranjan who is considered as the ultimate reality whereas the Sant Matt speaks of that which lies beyond the universe of Niranjan.
