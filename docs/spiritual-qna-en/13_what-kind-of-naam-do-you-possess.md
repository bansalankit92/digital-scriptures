 This is called as the Sar Naam. It is a rare kind of Naam that is altogether different from those of the 52 alphabets. At the time of blessing with Naam, the Sant Satguru awakens the power of Param Prush present within you. Then, taking your Soul within him, he once again places it in your body. This is the main action that separates your Mind from your Soul. It is this very activity that is called as blessing with Naam-Naam Dhaan. That Naam is Param Purush Himself. It remains with you at all the times to guard you, to turn you into a Hansa, to save you from the grip of Kaal Purush and Mind-Maya and to take you to Amarlok. In short, the Satguru Gives you the company of Sat Purush Himself in the form of Sar Naam. Otherwise, there is no power that can save the Jiva from the grip of Kaal Purush.

The holy sants clearly say that the true Naam can neither  
be spoken nor reduced to writing. None can know of it  
without a Satguru.

Satguru gives Sar Naam Through his Paras Surati
