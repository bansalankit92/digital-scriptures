Soul realization implies realizing the Soul as different from the Mind. Entire world and all relations are due to the Mind alone. All that man has engaged in the world is nothing but falsehood. This is because it is the Mind that has been motivating him for the same. Mind, intellect, Consciousness-remembrance, and ego are the different forms of Mind. It has cleverly entangled the Soul in these. Mind remains busy in expressing desires; the intellect remains busy in taking decisions; the consciousness helps in recalling the past incidences and it is ego that helps man perform all sorts of activities.  
Moving across the limit of these four forms and laboring to know the pure awakened Soul is called as realization of Soul.
