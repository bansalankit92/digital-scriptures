imprison the powerful parts of Param Purush? Niranjan meditated on Param Purush for a period of 204 Yugas. None in the entire Brahmand is more big worshiper than him. He is very powerful. He would have become stronger and would have tortured the Jeevas more and more, had Param Purush not prevented him from meditating on Him by hurling a curse. However, he is the 5th son of Param Purush whom He created like other Sons simply by uttering a word. None has the power to catch hold of the Soul. None can imprison itâ€”be it Maya or Mind. On the contrary, Soul has caught hold of Maya. Mind in a very tactful way entangled it in the Mayaic net. This is the reason behind its imprisonment.
