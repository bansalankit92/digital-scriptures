Once Dharam Dass Ji, in order to know about  
Amarlok and the creation of the universe, prayed to Sahib  
Kabir thus—

Abb Sahib Mohe Deu Batai, Amarlok Ki Kahan Rahai  
Kaun Deep Hans Ko Vasa, Kaun Deep Purush Rah Vasa  
Teen Lok Utpati Bakho, Baranhuskal Goye Jani Rakho  
Kaal Niranjan Kis Vidhi Bhaeu, Kaise Shodas Sut Nirmeyu  
Kaise Char Khani Vistari, Kaise Jeev Kaal Vash Dari  
Trideva Kaun Vidhi Bhayeu, Kaise Mahi Akash Nirmayeu  
Chander Surya Kahu Kaise Bhayeu,Kaise Taragan Sub Thayeu  
Kis Vidhi Bhei Sharir Ki Rachna Bhasho Sahib Utpati Bachna  
```  
O Sahib! Kindly tell me where does that Amarlok  
lie? At which place are the Jivas to be found there and  
how were the 3 Lokas, Kaal Purush and 16 sons created?  
How did this flawless Soul enter into the 4 Khanis? How  
did the Souls get entrapped in the net of Kaal Purush?  
How were the Tridevas, the earth, sky and the physical  
bodies created? Kindly tell me in detail all about this.  
Sahib Kabir said—

Tabb Ki Baat Sunhu Dharam Dassa,  
Jab Nehin Mahi Patal Akasha  
Jabb Nehin Kooram Brah Aur Shesh,  
Jab Nehin Sharad Gauri Ganesha  
Jabb Nehin Hatey Niranjan Raya,  
Jin Jeevan Kah Bandhi Jhulaya  
Taitees Koti Devta Nahin,  
Aur Anek Bataun Kahin  
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Ne Tahiya,  
Shaster Ved Puran Na Kehya  
Tabb Sub Rahe Purush Ke Mahin,  
Jyuin Batt Briksh Madhya Rah Shayin

O Dharam Dass! I am talking about the time when there was neither earth nor sky. There was no existence of Kooram, Barah, Sharad, Gauri, Ganesh, 33 crore gods and even Niranjan, the torturer of the Jivas. What more can I say, there was no existence of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, The Vedas, The Shastras and the Puranas even. But there was the One.  
Sahib Kabir says that at first Param Purush was all alone. He had no companion. Neither He has ever been created nor He will ever perish.  
That which is created, has to perish. But how can Param Purush who has never been created, perish? Sahib kabir tells Dharam Dass that Sakar, Nirakar, abodes—big and small—were created afterwards. As such, whose witness can he give? Even the 4 Vedas throw no light on the secrets related to Param Purush. They talk up to the limit of Niranjan alone.  
Describing the creation of the earth, sky, Brahmand,  
Niranjan, Tridevas and the like, Sahib Kabir says that first  
of all Param Purush desired and uttered a word. It created  
a rare kind of brilliant white light that spread to infinity.  
That light was not like the one to be found in this  
universe. Every particle of it could put crores of Suns to  
insignificance.  
When that light spread in the infinite, Param Purush  
Himself got absorbed into it. That light then became alive.  
It was just like the case of a body that becomes alive after  
the entry of Soul into it.  
Before entering into the light, Param Purush was  
unmanifest from sight but after entering into it, He was  
called as Satya Purush.  
  
  
The light that was Satya Purush Himself, came to be called as Amarlok. Imitating this, Niranjan, first of all created the 3 Lokas with the help of 5 material elements and then hid himself from sight and got absorbed into the 3 Lokas. Just as Amarlok is the body of Satya Purush, the 3 Lokas are the body of Niranjan.  
Satya Purush was still all alone. He desired and jerked away that light—His own self—from Him. Infinite number of droplets were formed out of it. These returned back to that light. It was just like the formation of droplets when one takes a handful of water, say from the sea, and throws it upward. However, the difference between the two was that while the droplets of water again fall into the sea and become a part of it, the droplets of light though did return to the light but they didn’t become a part of it. This is because Satya Purush desired that these should retain their separate identity. These very droplets were called as Hansas (Souls). Those Hansas began to move about in that light deriving indescribable bliss.  
Such a movement of the Hansas was miraculous, indeed. This is because the droplets of the sea have no separate identity. The jivas began to move about in that light in a manner a fish moves in water. Param Purush derived much pleasure from this and began to love those Hansas. They continued to enjoy like this for a long time.

Sada Anand Hoat Hai Va Ghar, Kabhu Na Hoat Udasa.  
```  
There are bliss and bliss alone to be seen in that Amarlok. No sorrows and sufferings are to be found there. There the light of a soul is equivalent to that of 16 Suns whereas the light of even a single pore of Param Purush is equivalent to that of crores of Suns and Moons. If it is so, just imagine what kind of Param Purush Himself would be. It is really beyond imagination and description.  
Then Param Purush created Sons simply by the uttering of words. That is to say, every word spoken by Him was turning into a Son. The second word created Kooram. Likewise, the third word created Geyan and the 4th one created Vivek.  
Param Purush saw that every word spoken by Him was changing into a Son, so He thought of making one like Himself. As such, He uttered a word in a forceful manner. Niranjan (Mind) was crerated out of it. In order to know whether the 5th Son was like Him or not, He merged Himself into him. For split of a moment He doubted that this body was not His own one. As such, He pulled Himself out of it and again entered into His own.  
Then He uttered the 6th word. Sahaj was created out of it. Then the 7th word created Santosh, the 8th one created Chetna, the 9th one created Anand, the 10th one created Khyama, the 11th one created Nishkam, the 12th one created Jalrangi, the 13th one created Achint, the 14th one created Prem, the 15th one created Deen Dyal whereas the 16th one created Dhairya. Param Purush created these sons simply to add glory to His Amarlok. All of them began to move about in that Amarlok. But the Soul was not created out of word. Sahib Kabir says;

Jeebra Ansh Purush Ka Aahi, Aadi Ant Kau Janat Nahin  
```  
Sahib says that jiva is the very part of Param Purush.  
None has any information about its beginning and ending.

Eeshwar Ansh Jeev Avinaashi, Chetan, Amal, Sehaj, Sukhrasi.  
```  
This Soul is a part of the Supreme Lord. It is Immortal (Avinaashi), spiritually active (Chetan), pure and free of vices (Amal). It is free from deceit and is spiritually simple (Sehaj). Besides, it is full of joy, happiness and bliss (Sukhrasi).
