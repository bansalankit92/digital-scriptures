In the Holy Scriptures, 4 kinds of salvation have been mentioned. These are—Salokya, Sameepya, Saroopya and Sajujya. Salokya means the attainment of Pitar Lok. Sameepya means the attainment of heaven. Saroopya means the attainment of Brahm Lok while Sajujya means the attainment of the Nirakar.

Whole of the world seems to be talking about sal- vation but none could know the secret related to the real form of salvation.  
Those engaged in Sakar (Formful) worship; attain the heaven or the Pitar Lok. They think they have attained salvation. The worshipers of Nirakar (Formless) attain Brahm Lok or Nirakar Lok. They too think they have attained salvation. Nevertheless, the secret of salvation can be understood only when we study the sayings of the holy Sants.  
In all the above-mentioned Salvations, there will be  
rebirth in this mortal world after a brief stay in their  
respected Lokas/heavens.  
The Soul will attain the real Salvation only when it  
frees itself from the 3 Worlds of Niranjan and reaches  
Amarlok from where it never returns to the earth.  
The Sagun worship is of a very limited nature. Suppose we have to go to America, a matador or a bus will not serve the purpose. As such, it cannot help us attain Sat Lok. Such worshipers are, however, born in some high family. However, if they happen to commit some wrong Karmas, they will have to pass, once again, through the cycle of repeated births and deaths. They endure disease or others handicap in one way or the other, attain the human birth after passing through the cycle of 84 Lakh lower Yonis. Whereas the noble persons attain the human birth, in the prosperous homes after their period in heaven ends.  
Anyhow, this much is certain that the Karmas — good or bad—can’t help us attain the real Salvation through the medium of these kinds of worship.  
Those who don’t want to absorb themselves too much in worship, perform the Sagun kind of worship. In addition, those who go deep, take to the Nirgun kind of worship. They pay attention to meditation and Yoga. Their level is somewhat higher. They attach significance to 5 kinds of Mudras. However, they too have their limit up to Nirakar only.  
The Yogis keep their beards and matted hair and carry a Trishool (a metal weapon with three pointed ends) in hand. The Jangams decorate their head with a crown of peacock feathers. The Sanyasis wear Bhagwa (a mixture of red and yellow) colored clothes. They are clean-shaven. The Vairagis-renounceate wear a necklace round their neck, Andhave keep long beard and hair, they carry a Kamandal (a special vessel) in hand. The Sevdas wear the necklace of Rudraksh and put ash on their bodies.  
The Nirgun worshipers do not take birth for Lakhs and crores of years but after every dissolution, when the earth again regains its form, they have to take birth repeatedly.

Kabir sahibji is saying that both bad deeds and good deeds are like the links of a chain which is used to bind the Soul. The only difference is that one is made of iron and the other is of gold.  
That is why Sahib kabir has talked about the true kind of worship where the Souls do not take birth again and again. This worship is much different from the Sagun as well as the Nirgun Kinds of worship. These 3 Worlds will perish. Kabir Sahib and other Sants have talked about Amarlok (Eternal world) where no dissolution takes place. That is a rare abode. When our Shastras and other holy scriptures agree that the soul is immortal, then it is but natural that its abode must Eternal. Then alone it can be called as the real and true. This is because—
