All the children of the same parents don’t have the same nature. Param Purush, in order to increase the Charm of His Amarlok, created Sons simply by the uttering of words. However, Niranjan turned out to be a bad Son and a torturer of the Jivas. When Param Purush was creating Sons, He, in order to create one like Himself, uttered a word in some forceful manner. It was not possible to create one like Himself because He was eternally existed never created and that which is created has to Perish. Except the Soul everything else has been created and as such, will perish with time. When that Son was created, Param Purush, in order to verify whether he was like Himself, entered his being.  
For a moment, He doubted that that was not His own self and so coming out of it at that very moment, He entered into His own. This created all the problem. Had He known that Niranjan would turn out to be such a of fellow, He would never have created him.
