Adhya Shakti had not committed much fault. This is because she didn’t want to do all this. She was, rather, frightened and forced by Niranjan to do so. She had fallen in his imprisonment and taking advantage of her helplessness he forced her to co-operate with him in the creation of the Mayaic world. Like the worldly ladies, she forgot the abode of Param Purush and co-operated with Niranjan in creating the Mayaic bodies.
