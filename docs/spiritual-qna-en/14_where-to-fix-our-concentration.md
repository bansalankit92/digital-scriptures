 We are talking about fixing the concentration on the Ashtam Chakra. The Yogis move up to the Saptam Chakra. These 7 Chakras lie within the body itself whereas the eighth Chakra lies at a height of one and one fourth of a hand above the head. This will make you realize that you are without a body (Maya) as well.
