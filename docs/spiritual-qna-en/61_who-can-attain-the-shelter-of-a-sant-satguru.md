This happens only after one performs noble deeds for many births. The time for the liberation of the Soul approaches and it seeks the shelter of the Satguru.  
sometimes the Sants themselves give their blessings. The Sants are the doers in the holy Durbar of Param Purush. Even Sahib Himself acts as per their dictates. They have freedom to do what they like. They can take anyone they like to His abode.
