No, neither it is possible to put even a very small thing into the Soul nor it is possible to take anything out of it. The evil Soul can in no way make its entry into the Soul. For instance, when a person takes wine, the intoxication effects his brain. As a result, his feet begin to lose balance. However, it doesn’t happen so with the Soul. Likewise, the effect of the evil Souls falls on our individuality. What to talk of evil souls, even death can’t dare to come near the Soul.
