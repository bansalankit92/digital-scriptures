Though Param Purush has given the Souls to Niranjan on account of his hard worship, yet He has put a safety cover over them. Kaal Purush can do no harm to them. Param Purush had not given the permission to put the Souls in bodies. Doing so, Niranjan has disobeyed Param Purush and has been reaping the fruit of it. It is Niranjan and not the Soul that suffers from the tortures.
