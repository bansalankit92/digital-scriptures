Rig Veda says—  
```text  
Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshvar  
Guru Sakshat Per Brahm, Tasme Shri Guru Ve Nama  
```  
Take the Guru himself as Brahma, Vishnu , Mahesh  
and Parbrahm and bow to him.  
Suppose, you don’t have faith in the Vedas as well. and if you are not a disciple, you will naturally think as to why should one worship a Guru. If you study the sayings of the holy Sants, you will find that they have not taken the Guru as God Himself. Had they said so, even then your argument would have carried no logic and if they had taken Him as Smaller in status than God, you would have thought over a little. But they have described the Guru as greater than God even. After all, there must be some reason behind it.

That Param Purush has nothing to do with the universe. He has handed over the rule of this universe to Niranjan. He is not in a position to free the Jivas from this worldly bondage. That is why He has given this job to the Sant Satgurus. This is a very difficult job that the Sant Satguru has to perform. You can’t worship Param Purush directly.  
We can fix concentration and can worship one whom we have seen. However, if we haven’t seen Him, we won’t be able to worship Him. Such a job is just like that of throwing stones at the moon. It is totally useless.  
Moreover, how can we attain salvation in that case?  
  
It is the Satguru alone who can perform such a job.  
That is why he has not been considered as less than God.  
Sahjo Bai has beautifully described this situation—  
```text  
Hari Ko Tajoon, Guru Ko Na Bisaroon  
Guru Ke Sum, Hari Ko Na Niharoon.  
```  
I am prepared to leave Hari but in no case I would  
like to forget the Satguru.  
```text  
Hari Ne Janam Diyo Jug Mahin,  
Guru Ne Avagaman Chhudahin  
```  
Hari (God) sent me in this universe but it is the Satguru who helped me cross the worldly ocean.  
```text  
Hari Ne Kutumb Jaal Mein Gheri.  
Guru Ne Kati Mamta Beri  
```  
Hari entangled me in the net of Maya whereas the Satguru destroyed this net of attachment.  
```text  
Hari Ne Paanch Chor Diye Satha,  
Guru Ne Chhudae Liye Snatha  
```  
Hari put 5 thieves ( Lust, anger, attachment, greed and ego ) with me whereas the Satguru saved me from their clutches.  
```text  
Hari Ne Mosey Aap Chhipayo,  
Guru Deepak De Tahi Lakhayo  
```  
God had hid Himself from me, but the Satguru helped me see Him with the power of Spiritual knowl- edge. Sahib Kabir says —  
```text  
Guru Gobind Donon Khare, Kake Lagoon Panv  
Balihari Guru Aapne, Gobind Diyo Lakhae  
```  
If both Guru and Gobind are standing before me, I would touch the holy feet of the Guru who helped me have a vision of lord.  
Let’s move to the basic question as to why we should worship the Satguru. Should it be taken as the worship of a human being? Not at all. We shouldn’t take the Guru as a human being. In his appearance, we should see the very appearance of Param Purush. I’ll explain to you this secret.  
When the Satguru moves with the Hansa, they first meet the Sidh Puriyan (A place where there is a display of miraculous powers). One comes to know as to how one can kill or cause some other kind of harm to others. The Soul gets attracted to these. It is just like the case of a penniless person whose joy knows no bounds when he happens to find a huge amount of wealth. However, the Guru pulls the Soul out of this attraction in a very careful manner. Travelling in this manner they reach Maha shunya. Both of them move together. The Guru goes on explaining everything to the Soul. After reaching the Mahashunya, the Satguru absorbs the Soul in himself.  
Many such Brahmands can be accommodated in that Maha shunya. 70 kinds of dissolutions are to be found there. Don’t take Sat Lok as an ordinary thing. Then he separates the Soul. Still the Soul is far from becoming a pure Hansa. Here the Soul asks as to why it had been concealed. Then the Satguru tells it that other than him, everyone else would be attracted by the powerful magnetic force of Kaal Purush. That is why he had absorbed it in himself.  
Dear devotees, whatever I have been saying is nothing but truth. In such circumstances, how can I agree with the views of one who says that one can cross the worldly ocean on one’s own. You won’t find all these things anywhere else. All others are busy in narrating the Kathas (events contained in the scriptures) but I am presenting before you pure things only.  
After this comes the ocean of Surti. The Guru leaves the soul of the disciple in this ocean. It revolves at an amazing speed of millions of times per second. It is just like the case of devotees who wash their hands and feet before entering into a temple or a mosque. When the Soul comes out of this ocean, it becomes a pure Hansa. The Mind is left behind. Don’t take this Mind as an ordinary thing. None has the power to separate his Mind. Next comes a point where the Guru as well as the disciple appear as two in one. Both seem to possess the same amount of power. They reach Param Purush. The latter asks the disciple as to whether he needs Him or the Guru. There the difference between Param Purush and the Guru appears the same as that between a lamp and the Sun. The Soul, as such, is attracted more towards Param Purush. If the Soul opts for Param Purush, it will remain for ever in Amarlok. He doesn’t let it absorb in Him. It will be a quite different thing if the disciple opts for the Satguru. It will happen only when he has always held the faith that Satguru himself is Param Purush. Then Param Purush feels much pleased and absorbs it in Himself.  
I have revealed to you a great secret. On sighting Param Purush the Hansa attains the light equivalent to that of 16 suns. But when it gets absorbed in Him, it becomes like Him.  
```text  
Sab Se Todd Ek Se Jodi, Satguru Tiska Naam.  
```  
When it descends on the earth, it has the rare Paras  
Surti with it.  
```text  
Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa.......  
```  
Param Purush asks such a Hansa to go to the earth and create awakening among the Jivas. Niranjan can’t even dare touch such a Paramhansa. When the Jivas are awakened, they will also remain unaffected by the power of Maya. Such a Paramhansa is called as Satguru.  
Then what will the Satguru do? On being blessed with Naam from such a Satguru, the whole play of Mind will end. Satguru performs this wonder with the help of his Paras Surti.  
Now it is up to you to decide whether the Satguru Worship is the same as the worship of a human being or that of Param Purush Himself.
