Te seek the shelter of a Satguru for attaining Param Purush, there is nothing in the universe that you can offer. All that is needed is firm faith and devotion in your Satguru. It is the Satguru, not you, who can offer  
anything.  
```text  
Guru Sman Data Nehin, Yachak Shishya Sman  
Teen Lok Ki Sampda, So Guru Deeni Daan  
```  
There is no great beggar than the disciple and no great donor than the Satguru who offers him in charity all the wealth to be found in the 3 Lokas.
