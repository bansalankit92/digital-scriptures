 No, we are not Kabir Panthis. The Kabir Panthis make the world move around Kabir Sahib whereas I make it move around me. If Kabir Panth is taken as Oil, The Sahib Bandgi should be taken as the refined Oil. If the former is taken as Butter, the latter should be taken as Ghee. The Kabir Panthis don’t believe in the status of a Satguru. They seem to forget that Sahib Kabir had sung not in his own glory but in the glory of the Satguru. As such, we are not Kabir Panthis. However, we take his sayings as a matter of evidence. Otherwise, a real Sant Satguru has no need of that. Nevertheless, the people won’t believe so easily, if I speak on the basis of my own experiences only.  
That is why I have to quote him as and when needed.
