 Guru can at the most have knowledge of the 3 Lokas (Jagatguru) whereas the Satguru has the knowledge of the 4th Loka as well. A Guru blesses with the Nsam related to Sagun or Nirgun method of worship whereas the Satguru blesses with the Naam related to the true and real form of worship related to Param Purush. A Guru simply shows the path without doing anything for himself and the disciple has to make his own earnings whereas the Satguru not only shows the path but also himself helps the disciple reach Amarlok.  
A Guru has no knowledge of Param Purush whereas a real Satguru not only has knowledge of Him but also actually descends on the earth after getting absorbed in Him. A Guru at the most has a knowledge of the 10 dwaras whereas a Satguru has the knowledge of the 11th (Surati) Dwara as well. The Naam blessed by the Guru is a worldly one and can be spoken, read as well as reduced to writing. It is related to the body. However, the Naam blessed by the Satguru is related to the Soul and is not a worldly thing. That is why it neither can be spoken nor can be read or reduced to writing. A Guru has no power to impart the true knowledge related to the Soul whereas a Satguru has the power to give. A Guru can show the path that can help a devotee attain the 4 kinds of salvation related to the 3 Lokas. He does not know the technique that can help one attain the real salvation- Param moksh.  
On the other hand, a Satguru reveals the real form of salvation that saves the devotee from the cycle of repeated births and deaths. This happens with the mere grace of the Satguru. Knowingly or unknowingly, the worldly Guru shows the path related to Niranjan but, after a brief period of unreal salvation, the devotee will have to take birth again and bear the tortures of Niranjan as before.

But for the spiritual knowledge of the Satguru, otherwise Jiva would have reached again the abode of Yama.

It would have wandered about in the net of 4 kinds  
of species ( Swat, egg, earth and womb) for Yugas  
together and would never have crossed the worldly ocean.  
However, the grace of the Satguru has freed it from this  
net. It will not suffer from the tortures of the Yamas now.

Guru Bin Bhav Nidhi Tarey Na Koi,  
Joh Viranch Shankar Sam Hoi.  
```  
Tulasi Sahib says that no being can cross this worldly ocean of birth and death without the blessings of a true Guru, even if a person is equivalent to Brahma ji and Shiv ji in all aspects.  
  
```text  
Koti Janma Ka Panth Tha, Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye.  
```  
The path of salvation that you have been traversing for  
many lives can be completed in a moment with the grace  
of Satguru.

“Guru Hain Badey Gobind Se, Mann Dekh Vichaar, Hari  
Sumrey Soh Vaar Hai, Guru Sumrey Soh Paar”.  
```  
Kabir sahib ji in his ideology of Bringa Matt reveals that Satguru is greater than supreme Lord” No one can’t meditate on one whom he has not seen, whereas Meditating on true Satguru will provide all help and protection to a being and will also provide Permanent Salvation-Param Mukti.
