The real Sants have given to the world the mes- sage related to Amarlok that lies beyond the 3 Lokas. They have said that the Lord of 3 Lokas is Kaal Purush who, acting against the wishes of Param Purush, has imprisoned the Souls in bodily cages. They give the message of the worship related to Param Purush. This method of worship is different from the worship preached by the Vedas and the Shastras. Moreover, they ask the Jivas to seek the shelter of the Satguru who would help them return to their original abode. He would do so after blessing them with Sar Naam.  
```text  
Chall Hansa Tu Desh Hamare, Satguru Dait Pukara Hain  
Satya To Kewal Amarlok Hai, Jhuta Yeh Sansara Hai  
```  
The Satguru gives a call to the Hansa to return to his country ( Amarlok ) which, unlike this unreal world, is the real and eternal one.
