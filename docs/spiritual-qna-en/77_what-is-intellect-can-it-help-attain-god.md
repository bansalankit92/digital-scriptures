No, this is a form of Mind. It is the intellect that takes decisions. In the guise of intellect, this Munn of ours misleads us. It does so by supplying the energy to the intellect. The person whose tissues of brain take a turn on the left side after passing through the neck, will become a left hander. All his energy will move to that side. Similerly, when the thought expresses some desire, its energy enters in its form that is Mind itself and when it enters the intellect—its other form—it sends its energy to it. When the Mind expresses desire, it is called as Thought and when it takes some decision, it is called as intellect. It means, all the decisions taken with our intellect are a hurdle in our path. This intellect is a great net of Mind.  
It is the Mind that has entangled the Soul in the world and imprisoned. It becomes clear that intellect is a weapon of Mind—in no way help us attain God.

Surrendering to Sants, the low class with no ego on caste, get liberated while those with ego about their higher status get drowned in the ocean of births and deaths.
