He is indescribable. Even one who has sighted Him Can’t give any description. Still, Sahib Kabir has given some hints for the common people to have a bit idea about Him.  
```text  
Koti Anant Yojan Lau Kaya, Kahan Lug Kahon Tasu Ki Chaya  
```  
You can imagine His body to have a spread up to innumerable Yojans. So to say, He is limitless  
```text  
Koti Kalap Yug Jaye Sirai, Mukh Anant Se Varni Na Jayi  
```  
It is not possible to give a description of Him even if an attempt is made to speak for Yugas together with innumerable mouths.  
Then talking about the forehead he says that if it is taken in a very subtle form, it will appear like innumerable suns and moons. It is not possible to give a description of his brilliance.  
```text  
Abb Netran Ko Kahon Pramana,  
Mano Anant Bhan Shashi Jana  
```  
Suppose He has eyes as well. Then these can be  
taken as innumerable Suns and Moons. It appears as if  
billions of lights have put together.  
```text  
Nasa Roop Kahun Prachanda, Mano Ajj Anant Brahmanda.  
```  
Again, suppose He has nostrils as well. These appear like countless Brahmands from where the strange kind of fragrance is spreading up to many Yojans.  
```text  
Shravan Roop Main Kahaun Bakhani,  
Anant Sindh Mano Smani  
```  
Suppose He has subtle ears as well. These appear to  
have countless seas in them with innumerable Lotus  
flowers (having no branches, leaves, roots etc.) blooming  
there. It is not easy to describe the beauty of all this.  
```text  
Abb Mukh Shobha Kahun Bakhani,  
Pind Brahmand Tehi Mahin Samani.  
Nau Shunya Jahan Lug Basa,  
So Mukh Bheeter Keenha Nivasa  
```  
  
  
Suppose He has a subtle mouth as well. The entire limit up to the 7 shunyas is to be seen in His mouth.  
```text  
Purush Roop Ka Barnan Bhai, Barnat Yaney Na Hoye Dithai  
```  
His appearance is indescribable. It is a futile attempt  
to describe His beauty.  
```text  
Purush Shobha Agam Apara, Mukh Anant Nehin Pavey Para  
```  
Even the countless mouths can’t describe His charm.  
```text  
Chikur Shobha Kahun Bujhai, Koti Ravi Sheesh Rom Lajai  
Kotin Chanda Soor Prakasha, Ek Ek Rom Anant Bhasa  
```  
Again, suppose He has hair. Every pore can put  
crores of Suns to insignificance.  
```text  
Shavet Akar Purush Ko Unga, Phatakvarn Dehi Ko Runga  
```  
He has a white appearance. There is nothing like this  
world to be found there.  
In the worldly language, that Sahib has the appearance in the form of word and light, .But this word and light are entirely different from those of this world.  
```text  
Jahan Lug Jeev Boond Hai Bhai,Tako Bhaid Kahaun Samujhai  
```  
Take the countless Souls as droplets, then Param Pu- rush as a mighty ocean of nectar.  
This description is based on supposition because that invisible God is of a very rare kind. He has made His appearance from the medium of brilliant white light.
