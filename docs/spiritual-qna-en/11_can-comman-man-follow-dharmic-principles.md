 At the time of blessing with Naam, the power to follow these was also are given. As long as you have not blessed with Naam, you are in the grip of Mind. And it makes you dance to its tune. However, after blessing you with Naam, your Soul will be separated from your Mind. Then the Soul will not be under the grip of Mind, even if it desires to do so. The Mind will not end but you will be can exercise your power on it. In such situations, you will be saved from doing wrongs. The power of Naam will continue to guide you on the right or wrong of things.  
Still if you commit the wrong, you will have to face punishment. Without Naam you are not in a strong position to judge whether some particular act is wrong or not. The Mind tactfully involves you in committing wrong acts. But, it will be unable do so after you get blessed with Naam. The power of Naam will, under all circumstances, bring reforms in you. In short, it will be easy for you to follow the principles if you keep your concentration fixed at your Satguru. This concentration will not let the Mind- Maya to keep you in their grip.
