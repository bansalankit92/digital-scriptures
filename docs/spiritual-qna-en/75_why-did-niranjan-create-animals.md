Had he created only the human beings, the things would have gone wrong. Repeated human births would have increased man’s state of awakening and would have made him remember his previous births. That is why man is made to forget all about it by making him pass through the repeated cycle of 84 Lakhs Yonis, lower life forms. But for this, man would have thought of attaining Salvation at the earliest and the whole play of Niranjan would have got spoiled. Man becomes awakened in the last period of his life. He has with him many experiences of life and begins to realize the imortence of Salvation.
