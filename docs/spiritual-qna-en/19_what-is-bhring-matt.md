There are 27 Lakh varieties of insects to be found in the world. Among them it is the Bhring that possesses rare virtues. It is male and has no female. It makes a house out of mud. It can fly at a great speed. It has a magic in its sound. It catches any insect and taking it in its house it whispers its sound into its ears. With its charming sound it turns the insect like itself. However, it can’t do so if the insect doesn’t listen to its sound. After moving about, it again comes to whisper its sound in its ears. If again it fails to turn the insect like itself, it flies away and after taking a round, makes the third and the final attempt. If the insect listens to its sound, it turns in to a Bringa, but if it doesn’t coperate then the Bhring lets it go. The latter remains as an insect like before. It fails to become another Bhring. Then the Bhring moves in search of some other larve and repeats the same process on it.  
The Satguru also performs the same kind of work. He makes the disciple like himself with the power of his Paras Surti. The insect has to do nothing at all. It is the Bhring itself that catches the insect and brings it to its abode. Putting it down it whispers its word into its ears. The insect has only to show its willingness to listen to the word. What can the Bhring do if the insect doesn’t listen?  
In this regard Sahib Kabir has said—  
```text  
Bhringi Shabad Keet Jo Jana, Varan Phair Aapan Ker Jana  
```  
The insect that listens to the word of the Bhring, loses its previous identity and becomes like the Bhring Itself. That is to say, it will lose its previous nature and behavior.  
```text  
Koyi Koyi Keet Param Sukhdai, Pratham Aavaz Gahe Chitlai  
```  
Some good-natured insects listen to the very first  
sound and become like the Bhring.  
```text  
Koyi Dooje Koyi Teeje Maney.Tann Munn Rahit Shabad Hit  
Janey.  
```  
Some insect listens to the sound in the second at-  
tempt while some other listens to it in the third attempt.  
  
```text  
Bhring Shabad Keet Na Gahei To Puni Keet Asre Rahei  
```  
However, the insect that doesn’t listen to the word  
out of fear or otherwise, remains as an insect as before.

Guru Shabad Nishchaya Satya Maney, Bhringi Matt Tab Pavei  
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabad Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavei  
```  
A disciple becomes a Hansa only if he takes the words of the Satguru-(Paramhans) as truth and truth alone. The Satguru turns the crow like nature of such a disciple into that of a Hansa. In fact, the words of the Satguru are soothing like those of the Bhring. All that is needed is firm faith and devotion.  
```text  
Pahle Data Shishya Bheya, Jin Tann Munn Arpa Sheesh  
Peechhe Data Satguru Bheya, Jin Naam Diya Bakhshish.  
```  
The disciple is the first donor who offers his body, mind, and possessions at the holy feet of the Guru whereas the Satguru is the second donor who blesses the former with Naam.  
All others are talking about the easy path but they are talking about the earning merits as well. Sahib Kabir says that the disciple need not do anything. Rather, it is the duty of the Satguru to do all that are needed; spiritual knowledge, devotion, control over mind, and other related things will automatically come to the disciple.  
This wonder is performed with the power of the Satguru. Therefore, devotion matters not ego. Some one asked me if everything goes on with the grace of the Satguru, it means the acts of cheating are also done with his consent. I asked him to listen to me patiently. A devotee, who is in complete surrender to the Satguru, can in no case do any wrong act. You will reap the reward as per your Karmas (deeds) if you behave under the sway of nature and Mind. If you deliberately try, fall in a well, you will definitely fall into it. However, the Satguru saves the real devotee from such misfortunes by turning the tide of Karmas.  
```text  
Koti Karam Pall Mein Katey, Jo Aawe Guru Oat.  
```  
  
Countless Karmas of a devotee who seeks the shelter  
of a Satguru, get washed away in a moment.  
The Guru will come to your rescue as and when he foresees any misfortune approaching near. All that will happen, will go in your favor. That is to say, it is the Guru who has to decide as to what is right or wrong for you.  
```text  
Surti Karau Mum Saiyan, Hum Hain Bhavjal Mahin  
Aap Hi Hum Bah Jayen Ge, Jo Na Gaho Ge Bahin  
```  
O Sahib! We are in the midst of deep waters. Keep  
your merciful attention on us or else we shall get drifted  
away.  
There are many Gurus in the world who say they will take the devotees across the worldly ocean of death. However, on watching their followers one finds that their nature remained unchanged. That is to say, they are not the real Gurus. Sahib Kabir has cautioned the devotees in this regard. He says —  
```text  
Bhrang Mata Hoye Jihi Pasa, Soyi Guru Satya Dharam Dassa  
```  
O Dharam Dass! Take only that Guru as real who has the power to turn the devotee like himself in a manner the Bhring does

```text  
Satguru Ke Updesh Ka, Suniya Ek Vichar.  
Jo Satguru Milta Nahin, Jata Yam Ke Dwar.  
Yam Dware Mein Doot Sab, Kate Enchatani.  
Unte Kabhu Na Chhutta, Firta Charon Khani.  
Chari Khani Mein Bharmta, Kabhun Na Lagta Par.  
So Fera Sab Miti Gya, Satguru Ke Upkar.  
```  
Listen and know that without a Satguru there is no one to take you accross this Worldly Ocean of Life and Death. None else can help free from four types of birth, only by the grace of a living Satguru one attains Param Moksh
