The devotee who doesn’t follow even a single principle, has to face punishment. Don’t think the devotee will receive punishment only after I come to know of it. It will be like an automatic process. Disregard in any form will invite punishment. It doesn’t mean the punishment will be given at that very time. It can be spread over a number of days. This is the concession a Naami can hope to get. The punishment depends on the nature of wrong done. In my life I have given a big punishment to two offenders.  
I forbade them from coming to me again. Moreover, they lose the power to fix their concentration on me. This is the last and the final punishment a great spiritually enlightened sage awards. Then all doors of forgiveness are closed. It is equivalent to irrevocable death penalty.

Kabir keeps his attention focused on his Satguru whether  
he is sleeping or awake, standing or sitting or doing just  
anything
