Sahib Kabir has described in detail the char- acteristics of a true Sant. You should check these. Firstly, he shouldn’t be engrossed in Maya. He shouldn’t be a family holder. In case he had entered into a family life, he should have deserted it after becoming enlightened and should have devoted his life for the good of the Jivas. If you keep these things in mind, you won’t commit any wrong in finding out the true Sant. Just Imagine! He whose soul has been absorbed in Param Purush has to take all the Jivas like his children. Then how can the question of leading a family life arise? Still, if such a Sage decides to enter into a family life, take it for granted he is absorbed in Maya and hasn’t reached the spiritual heights. A real Guru who is spiritually enlightened, will never get absorbed in Maya even if he desires to do so.  
In the Vedas and the Shastras we come across many instances when the great Rishi Munies, under the impulse of lust or anger, committed many wrong acts. What was all this? It was a clear proof of the fact that their limit was up to Niranjan. They were unable to pierce the clouds of Maya and reach Param Purush. That is why the Satguru who reaches Param Purush remains safe from the net of Maya and his devotee who gets blessed with Nam from such a Satguru, remains safe from maya.   
Other characteristics are —  
  
1. He should live on his own earnings. If he depends  
   on the offerings of the disciples or lives on begging, he  
   can in no case be called as a Sant.  
2. He should have the needed knowledge to clear the  
   misconceptions of the disciples.  
3. He should be free from all sorts of worldly relations. If he is not so, then he will work for them and at the time of departure he will hand over the Guru Gaddi to one among his relations and as per the preveiling trend the worldly people will start worshipping his heir taking him as a Sant.  
4. He should be a follower of truth. There is nothing  
   greater than truth in the eyes of the Sants.  
5. He should be impartial in his behavior.  
6. His soul must be absorbed in Param Purush. Only preching with bookish knowledge about Param Purush and His Amarlok to others can’t serve the purpose.
