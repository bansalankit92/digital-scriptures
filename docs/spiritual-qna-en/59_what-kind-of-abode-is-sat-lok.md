As such Sat Lok is Param Purush Himself, so it  
is not possible to give a description of it.  
```text  
Ved Kateb Paar Nehin Pavat, Kahan Sunan Se Neyara Hai  
```  
Even the Vedas and the other religious scriptures  
don’t have a knowledge of it. It is a rare kind of abode.  
```text  
Jahan Jaye Phir Hans Na Aawe,Bhavsagar Ki Dhara  
```  
The Hansas after reaching there don’t come again to the mortal world.  
There is no light of the Moon, the Sun and the Stars. There are no days and nights even. There is no existence of the 5 material elements, the net of worldly relations, hunger, thirst, sorrows and pleasures, diseases and problems etc. that are related to the body alone. These are not to be found there because there are no physical bodies. further, there is no such problem like that of high and low, Caste, religion and the like. That abode is the most beautiful of all. Its beauty and splendor can’t be described in words. The beauty of the 3 Lokas fades before it.

Pind Brahmand Ko Tahan Na Lekha,  
Lokalok Tahvan Nehin Dekha  
Aadi Purush Tahvan Asthana,  
Yeh Charittar Eko Nehin Jana  
```  
There is no existence of the body, Brahmand and the  
abodes —big or small. None knows that, that very Loka is  
the abode of Param Purush.

Apahi Kanda Taul Taraju, Apahi Taulan Hara.  
Apahi Leve Apahi Deve, Apahi Hai Banajara.  
Apahi Guru Puni Shishya Apahi, Aap Aap Ka Khel Hai Sara.  
```  
Kabir sahib says that the Supreme Lord Sahib is the balance, He is the weight and He is the one who is weighing. He is the one who gives, He is the one who takes and He is the vagabond. It is He who is the Guru, it is He who is the disciple, and all of us are in your scheme of things
