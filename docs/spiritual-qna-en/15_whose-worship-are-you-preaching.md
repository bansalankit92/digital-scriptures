We give the worship of Param Purush. All the Souls are a part of Him. His abode is in Amarlok that lies far beyond the 3 Lokas. He is the same Param Purush whom Kaal Purush worshipped hard to get blessed with the rulership over 3 Lokas along with innumerable Souls. The same Param Purush who, on hearing the painful cries of the Jivas, sends Kabir Sahib in the guise of a Sant to free them from the clutches of Kaal Purush. He doesnâ€™t take back all the Jivas forcefully because he is bound by the word He has given to Kaal Purush in this regard.  
That is why He has to adopt the technique of taking them back in a phased manner.

Surti Bandhi Asthir Karo, Guru Mein Deyi Samaye.  
Kahein Kabir Dharam Dass Se, Agam Panth Lakhaye.

When Dharam Dass prayed to Kabir Sahib as to how could a devotee reach there, the latter said that a devotee should fix his Surti (Dhyan-concentration) at his Satguru.( not in one's own body-maya)

Devi Dewal Jagat Mein, Kotik Poojey Koye.  
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sabb Ki Pooja Hoye.  
```  
Worship of Satguru, amounts to the worshiping of  
whole universe.
