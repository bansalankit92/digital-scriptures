No, One reaches at the abode of one’s deity. We can know in two ways about the abode one attains after departure from the world. The Karmas they performed give us a lot of information about it. If the one lived a noble life, didn’t torture anyone and worshiped some or the other deity, he would find a place in the heaven. If he was engaged in the worship of ancestors and did noble deeds, he would attain Pitar Lok.  
If he has done evil and sinful deeds, he would go, straightway, to hell. If he had been performing Yog along with doing noble deeds, he would attain either Brahm Lok or Niranjan Lok, depending on the Mudra he had practiced. On the other hand, if one is blessed with Sajeevan Naam from a Satguru, and worshiped him, he would attain Amarlok.  
Then everyone who departs from the world, leaves  
some indication about his whereabouts. At this, Sahib  
Kabir has said—

Mall Dwar Se Jeev Nikasa, Narak Khani Mein Paye Vasa  
```  
If the prana (Life Breath) escape from the anus, the  
being attains hell. As an indication of it, the stool of the  
deceased will come out at that time.

If the prana escape from the navel, the Jeev will  
attain the Yoni of the water dwellers like fish etc. As an

```  
If the prana escape through the mouth, the Jeev will  
attain the Yoni of the insects that feed on grains. As an  
indication of it, the mouth of the deceased will remain  
wide open.

```  
If the pranas escape through the breath, the Jeev attains the Yoni of the birds etc. As an indication of it, the filth from the nose of the deceased will come out.

```  
If the prana escape through the eyes, the Jeev attains  
the Yoni of a fly, mosquito etc. As an indication of it, the  
eyes of the deceased will remain wide open.  
```text  
Shravan Dwar Se Jeev Jab Chala, Prait Deh Paye Tatkala  
```  
If the prana escape through the ears, the Jeev, at  
once, attains the Yoni of Spirits of neither worlds. As an  
indication of it, the body of the deceased will have a  
fearful appearance.  
```text  
Dasham Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Swarg Lok Mein Vasa Payi  
```  
If the prana escape from the 10th dwara, the jeev  
attains heaven. As an indication of it, the face of the  
deceased will give a pleasant look.  
```text  
Ranbh Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Amarlok Mein Vasa Payi  
```  
If the pranas escape through the 11th dwara, the Jeev  
attains Amarlok. It remains forever in the abode of Param  
Purush and never returns to this mortal world. As an  
indication of it, the Jeev will appear to be sleeping. Also,  
it will appear as if it may get up at any moment. So to say,  
it will look peaceful.
