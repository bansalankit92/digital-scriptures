It is true that there are no 5 material elements in Amarlok, no bodies made out of these, no Guru or the disciple but we haven’t to talk about such things here. When a criminal appears before the judge, he has to bow for fear of punishment. In the same manner, a devotee has to bow before a Satguru, because it is he who has the power to take him out of the prison of Niranjan. One won’t find the physical body of the Satguru there but the Satguru, after absorbing himself in Param Purush, assumes His appearance and enters into the physical body to make us understand all this. That is why he has to be considered as greater than Param Purush Himself and has to be worshiped. As far as the question of fixing of concentration is concerned, it is the eyes where the concentration has to be fixed. This has to be done during meditation. In the awakened state that God element is present in the eyes. That is why this concentration can’t be called as the material one. It is, so to say, the act of fixing concentration at Param Purush. That is why are advised to look into the eyes of the Satguru while performing salutations. Looking into the eyes means to have a vision. As you don’t know His real appearance, you are not in a position to understand this secret. A Satguru comes to the world as per the will of Param Purush to liberate the Jivas.
