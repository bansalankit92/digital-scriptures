Yes, every man has 6 bodies with him. They are—Sathool, Suksham, Karan, Mahakaran, Geyan and Vigyan. Man doesn’t have a complete knowledge of himself. Let’s talk about them one by one.  
  
1. **Sathool Sharir** — It is our own physical body. All can see it. It is a perishable body. The Gods don’t have it. We reside in this very body. That is why all of us have a knowledge of it. However, the power of this body is limited. With our material eyes we can see up to some definite distance only. Likewise, with the material ears we can hear the sound coming from some reasonable distance and range. We can use our mouth to send our sound to some limited distance alone. The same is true in case of other organs as well.  
2. **Suksham Sharir** — We attain this body when we are in sleep. The Jiva finds itself in quite a different kind of world called as the Dreamland. There is a very subtle cells on the left side of our throat. We reach when our concentration fixed there. We take the very world we find there, as the real one. Just as in our awakened state, we take this unreal world that we see with our gross body, as the real one, in the same manner, we take the strange world we see with the subtle body we attain in our dreams, as the real one. Man has a very close relation with this subtle body and the world of dreams. This is because one can see many events related to many past births.  
  
In the dream world it is we who are the actors. This sounds very strange. Man is not aware of this. We move from this gross body into that subtle body. After all, what was that which escaped from the gross body and entered into this subtle one? That subtle body does all sorts of works and watches  
all the activities. Then again we return to our gross body. However, we fail to understand as to how we moved out and how we returned. What was that which moved out? The first body became lifeless whereas the second one became alive. If we happen to meet our brother, we at once recognize him. So to say, everything appears to be real. This is the miracle of this second body. What a strange thing! Though we read at many places that this material world is dream like, still we don’t change our thoughts.  
You never think over as to why did you enter into the dream state. A certain scientist has been making a search about the dreams for the past 40 years. Nevertheless, I say I’ll explain to him within a moment all about dreams.  
In the dream, state, if we happen to face sorrows and sufferings, these will give us the same amount of pain as we would feel in our awakened state. On the other hand, if we find pleasures, these would appear to us as much real as we would have felt in our awakened state. No doubt, this human body is of a very rare kind.  
Appearing of every thing as true and real is nothing but a play of our Indrias- Senses.  
When the same Soul is present in all, what is responsible for the difference in the amount of knowledge? This is because of the difference in the structure of different bodies. Some vehicles can move at the speed of 150 Km an hour. However skilled the driver be, he can’t make such a vehicle run at a greater speed. It is the case with the body too. The soul regulates it as per its structure.  
  
3. **Karan Sharir** — This is a very rare body. It is related to meditation. It is very powerful. Try to understand its power. Suppose you are attending the Satsang and are looking at me and listening to my discourse, but if for a moment divert your concentration to some other thing, you are unable to listen to my words and understand me and even while watching and very much sitting near me. That is to say, the power to see, hear and understand is due to concentration only. If you are able to have a knowledge of this body, you can send it anywhere you like to collect some information about that place. With the power of this very body, sometimes man recollects his old days while at other times he begins to have a glimpse of his future life. Some say they happened to see some evil spirit. It came near due to the power of the Karan Sharir only. Sometimes your attention gets turned to someone even when you haven’t even thought of him. Soon that fellow appears before you. That is to say, the fellow was near you through Karan Sharir. None else was able to sight him. This is, indeed, the miracle of this Karan sharir.  
   Again, sometimes you find someone engrossed in some deep thoughts. You reach near him and ask in which thoughts he has been lost. Sometimes this happens with you as well. So to say, man can find many miracles if he makes a search for the same. Even you yourself fall in such a position. It is a reality but the system of our physical body doesn’t seem to recognize it.  
   A certain Nami- Initiate told me that a Serial related to the past life was being telecast on the TV. He asked if such a thing actually happened. I told him that everyone has a knowledge of his past 100 lives but the capacity of the body is limited. How can we remember the happenings of 100 lives when we can’t recollect even that which we have heard a few moments before? If someone makes an attempt to repeat that which he heard some minutes before, he will surely forget many things. Then how can we ever hope to recollect the happenings of one's 100 lives?  
The Hindu religion says—  
1. God exists.  
2. The soul is immortal.  
3. The soul has to enter into different bodies as per its Karmas.  
```text  
   Janam Ek Nehin Janam Aneka, Chhote Nehin Karam Ko Lekha  
```  
   The Karmas of many lives are with us. We can’t get rid of them.  
   It is only the Soul that remembers the happenings of many lives. Sometimes you say you would see on reaching Amarlok as to what kind of appearance do the Soul, Amarlok, and Param Purush have. However, it is a fact that you have a knowledge of Param Purush, Amarlok as well as the Soul. Believe that, you know all this due to your being a Soul. Nevertheless, your present conscience doesn’t seem to accept it.  
   Our brain turns it as supposition. A horse will collapse if we put 6 quintals of load on it. Likewise, the brain doesn’t want to store the extra knowledge in it. If it tries to do so, one will turn mad. That is why it remains engrossed in the current problems only and terms the information being provided by the Soul as unreal.   
   If a child, right from the childhood, desires to be a wrestler, take it for granted he was a wrestler in his previous birth as well. The same is true in case of other desires like becoming a Sage, a Teacher, a Doctor and alike. In such cases the Mind and the consciousness make the same kind of movement.  
   Vasudev Krishan too tells Arjun that he has no knowledge of his previous births whereas he (Krishan) has a knowledge of the past 100 lives.  
There is no other system in the world that can enable us meet anyone we like. However, this Karan Sharir can help us meet our ancestors as well.  
All the religions lay stress on meditation. But it is our Mind that causes a hurdle on our path of entering into other bodies. It remains engaged in finding as to what is right or wrong for the body. It has no power to think beyond it.  
We can’t do anything without the proper system. Just as we can’t use our nose to see objects and can’t use our ears to enjoy fragrance and so on, in the same manner, we can’t experience the rare Worlds with the help of this physical body. Suppose we want to fly, we won’t be able to do so for lack of the needed system in us. We watch the outward glimpse of worship where the Mahatmas are seen dancing, jumping, weeping and doing all such superfluous activities.  
Sahib Kabir has said—

Surti Se Dekh Sakhi Vo Desh  
```  
One can have the vision of Amarlok through  
concentration alone.  
  
1. **Mahakaran Sharir** — This is a very rare kind of body. Man practices Yog for attaining it. The Yogis on attaining this body move about in the Brahmands. This body is a storehouse of miraculous powers  
   This body is smaller than even the grain of masoor (a kind of pulse). To attain it, one has to fix concentration at the Trikuti. Disappearing from one place and appearing at some other, is all due to it. It helps in reaching Brahm Lok as well. This is called as the opening of interior eyes as well. Remember! You are not an ordinary person. You are a part of Param Purush.  
2. **Gyan Dehi** — Getting this Sharir, the Yogi begins to consider himself as Brahm. This is because he attains the power to give birth to a new creation on his own. Whatever he Speaks, begins to happen. Often we hear about such and such God. This miracle is due to the attaining of this very sharir.  
  
6. **Vigyan Dehi** — On attaining this Sharir, the Mind  
   reaches in a state of unconsciousness. So to say, it reaches  
   in a state of Coma whereas the Soul becomes very much  
   awakened.  
   Goswami Ji has described this state in a beautiful  
   manner —  
   ```text  
   Pug Bina Chaley Sune Bin Kana,  
   Binu Karam Karey Vidhi Nana  
   ```  
   The devotee can move without feet, can hear without  
   ears and can do a lot of works even without any effort  
   He also says that the devotee, even without  
   speaking, can become a great orator and can see without  
   eyes. That is to say, it is not possible to describe the glory  
   of this Sharir.  
   It enables the Jiva watch a variety of mysterious  
   plays. All this happens after passing through the 10th  
   Dwara. The Ida and Pingla attain a unison when this  
   happens. Apart from man, none else is in possession of  
   this body.  
   ```text  
   Sabb Ki Gathri Lal Hai, Koi Nahi Kangal.  
   ```  
   Every human being has great hidden miraculous  
   powers within them.
