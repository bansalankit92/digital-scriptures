 First we have to understand that the word we are talking about is neither Varnatmic (Alphabatic) nor Dhunatmic (Sound) nor any musical note. It is very differ- ent from the 70 kinds of musical notes emanating from within the body.  
That is to say, it is Muktatmic Word (Soundless Sound). There are no Musical notes in it. In short, it is altogether different from every word to be found or understood in the World.

Koti Naam Sansar Mein, Tin Te Mukti Na Hoye.  
Mool Naam Jo Gupat Hai, Janey Birla Koye.  
```  
There are crores of ‘Naams’ in the world. Nevertheless, these can’t help us achieve salvation. On the other hand, the true Naam is a hidden one and only some rare sants have it.  
```text  
Kaha Na Jahi, Likha Na Jayi. Bin Satguru Koyi Nahin Payi.  
```  
The holy sants clearly say that the true Naam can neither be spoken nor reduced to writing. None can know of it without a living Satguru
