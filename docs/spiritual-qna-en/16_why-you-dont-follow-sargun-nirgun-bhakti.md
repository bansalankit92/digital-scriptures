 Both- Sakar and the Nirakar- kinds of worship are perishable. All the things made out of the 5 material elements are called as Sagun or Sakar. All of us know that the 5 material elements are perishable but still, none gives a serious thought to the fact that even element Sky is included in the 5 elements and it is Nirakar. As such, the worship of Nirakar is nothing but the worship of the perishable element.
