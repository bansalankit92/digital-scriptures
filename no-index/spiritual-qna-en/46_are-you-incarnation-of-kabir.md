It is the duty of the disciple to take his Guru as the very appearance of God. I have never said that I am Sahib or it is I who have been doing each and everything. I have never said such a thing for myself. I have said for Sahib alone. Whenever some devotee comes to me with some problem, I always ask him to have faith in Sahib. I never ask them to have faith in me for the solution of their problems. If the disciples believe in any such thing, it speaks of their faith. They have a right to say so. Sahib Kabir has said that in Kal Yug as well, he will again appear on the earth and will float a Panth to enable a large number of Jivas attain salvation.

Jambu dweep than baithai, dehi paan tabb Panth chalayi  
```  
I shall appear near the continent Jambu and will float a Panth.  
None has complete knowledge of the teachings of Sahib Kabir. Only a Sant can understand the meaning inherent in the sayings of other Sant. In my sayings, you will find quotes of Kabir Sahib. I have made the devotees understand the message of Sahib Kabir. That is why my disciples express similar views. Neither I have to speak of my greatness nor I have to shake the faith of the disciples. It is up to you to make any opinion in this regard.

Paras mein aur Sant mein, tu bado antaro maan.  
Voh loha kanchan karey, yeh karlein aap samaan.

There is a big difference between a Paras (a touchstone)  
and a Saint (Sant). Paras can only transform an iron into  
gold but not into paras. Whereas, a true Saint transforms a  
human being alike Himself just through His supreme  
concentration.
