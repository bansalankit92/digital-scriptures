Necessity is the mother of invention. This uni- verse is an abode of sufferings and sorrows. All have been imprisoned here. Moreover, a prisoner cannot remain in a state of joy and pleasure. From the very birth, one has to face sufferings and sorrows. The child has to suffer a lot for 9 months in the womb of the mother. Then there is the filth of bags of urine and stool. Further, it remains entrapped in a narrow path. Then after taking birth, a new line of sufferings and sorrows makes its appearance. It receives the thrashing from one or the other. Sometimes, It has to suffer from one or the other bodily problem. On other occasions, it feels sad if it fails to get the desired thing or loses that which it had. These sorrows and sufferings remain with him even when he grows young or old.  
That is to say, sufferings and sufferings alone found  
here.

Yogi Dukhiya Jangam Dukhiya, Tapsi Ko Dukh Doona  
Aasa Trishna Sub Ghat Veyapat, Koyi Mahal Na Soona  
```  
Here even the Yogis, Jangams and the Tapsi (worshipers of different deities) are seen suffering from one or the other kind of sorrow. Different kinds of desires continue to haunt them. None seems to be safe from these.  
Then there is the sorrow of death. All those who helped us in one way or the other are seen leaving the world one by one. There is also the sorrow of passing through different kinds of Yonis as per oneâ€™s Karmas. These include many dirty and hateful Yonis like that of dog, mosquito, cockroach, pig and the like. Who would take these as pleasures?  
God (Param Purush) can never give such troubles to His own Souls-parts. He, rather, remains worried about freeing them from such sad plight.  
When the holy sants give to the people the message of Param Purush, people do not take them seriously. The worldly people seem to have nurtured a liking for this very world.

I pull him towards Sat Lok but he goes to Yampuri  
bound in chains.  
Salvation is necessary for escaping from the tortures  
of Kaal.
