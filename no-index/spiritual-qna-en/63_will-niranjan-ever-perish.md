Yes, One day Niranjan will perish. However, it will take some time. This is because he has been blessed by Param Purush to rule over the 3 Lokas for a period of 17 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas (10^27 Yugas).  
47 Lakh years make 4 Yugas and 4 Yugas make one  
Chaukri Yuga.   
10 Sankhya Chaukri yugas make one Asankhya Chaukri Yuga. At present, 4 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas (24%) have expired. That is to say, the earth will yet face dissolution millions of times more. It is only then that Niranjan will perish (End Time).
