Certainly not, The Beings can’t escape from the grip of Niranjan even after worshiping for crores of years, Niranjan won’t allow the Jiva to even reach him. Even if the beings manage to do so, it will forget its own identity. Under no circumstances, the Jiva can hope to attain permanent salvation. It is only Sant Satgurus who are in possession of the 'Paras Surti'. with its miraculous power they absorb the Jiva within them and take it to Amarlok. If the Satgurus don’t do so, the powerful attraction of Mind and Maya will bring the Jiva back to the earth.

Jeev Bechara Keya Karey, Jo Na Chhudave Peev  
```  
The poor and helpless Jiva can’t do anything on its own. It is only the Satya Purush Himself who can save it.  
Those who don’t believe it, ask their followers to do charitable acts, prayers and pay visits to the holy places to attain salvation. This is because they have no alternative but to oppose the teachings of Sahib Kabir.  
Sahib Kabir says that it is not possible for the Jiva to escape from the clutches of Niranjan. In the Kathas ( recitations of stories from the holy books ) we hear about the great Rishi Munies who worshiped hard for years together but committed wrong acts under the sway of Lust and anger. If this is the case with great worshipers, how can a ordinary human being ever think of escaping from the powerful net of Mind and Maya. Lust and anger are only the hands of this Mind. That is why it is said—

Kitne Tapsi Tapp Ker Darey, Kaya Dari Gara  
Grah Chhor Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pavat Para  
```  
Many worshipers worshiped hard. Some of them even reduced their bodies to a skeleton. Some left their homes and hearths even but still they failed to attain salvation.  
A sage asked as to how Guru would take the disciple across the limit of three Lokas. He said that he was at a loss to understand all this. No doubt, it is beyond the reach of that sage. The simple reason, he is not equipped with that power for the same. Sahib Kabir says—  
```text  
Is Ke Aage Bheid Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Janan Hara  
```  
The secret related to him lies beyond it. Only some  
experienced person can have knowledge of it.  
Those connected with other Panths ask their disciples to perform all sorts of rites related to Yog. That is why they don’t attach so much importance to the Guru. But the Sants have accorded a very high place to the Satguru. Sant Matt is altogether different from other Panths. Earlier it was the word ’Yog’ that was prevalent. The word ‘ Sant’ was nowhere to be found. In Sant Matt, an easy path-Sahaj Marg for attaining salvation is preached. The Sants say it with confidence that the Satguru will help the disciple go across the worldly ocean within moments. Has any Rishi Muni said so? Certainly not will be the answer. The Sant Matt revolves round the Satguru. It doesn’t talk of simply showing the path with instructions. A Nirgun worshiper of Formless will talk of one’s own earnings. This gives rise to misconceptions. We are talking about two things—The sighting-Dharsan of Satguru and service to him. So the lineage of Sants revolves around these two things.  
```text  
Hari Sewa Yug Char Hai, Guru Sewa Pal Ek  
```  
Even after serving God for 4 Yugas, one can’t attain  
so much merit as one can attain by serving the Guru even  
for a moment.  
  
Goswami Ji also said—  
```text  
Yeh Sub Sadhan Se Na Hoyi, Tumhari Kripa Payey Koyi Koyi  
```  
Not with self efforts, but with the grace of Sahib,  
one can attain salvation. Sahib Kabir has said—  
```text  
Ada Ker Khud Khazane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko  
```  
He asks the Guru to free the Jiva with Guru's own  
power of grace.  
That is to say, in this universe of Kaal (that is not the real abode of the Jiva) the Hansa of Param Purush has got entangled in many chains. It is impossible for it to free itself from these chains on its own and reach Amarlok—  
its real abode. Kabir Sahib said -  
```text  
Pap Punya Ye Dono Beri, Ek Loha Ek Kanchan Keri.  
```  
Sahib is saying that both bad deeds and good, virtuous deeds are like the links of a chain which is used to bind the soul. The only difference is that one is made of iron and the other is of gold.  
Both kinds of worship—Sagun (With Form) as well as Nirgun (Formless)—lay stress on making one’s own earnings of merits. Here the Guru simply shows the path. The devotee can rise only to the extent he makes the earn- ings. This approach is limited to the 3 Lokas alone, where the earnings and deeds bring fruit. Those who can’t afford to make suitable arrangements for the same, waste away their lives. However, in the true form of worship- Satya Bhakti there is no importance attached to Karmic earnings. This worship is related to Amarlok where there is no requirements, whatsoever, of the Karmic earnings.  
In Mahashunya, there are to be found many strong kinds of magnetic attractions where the Jiva forgets itself. At this time the Satguru brings it to senses and absorbing it in himself, takes it safely to Amarlok.  
Otherwise, the devotee can’t ever hope to cross those places even after worshiping for crores of years.   
Now Sant lineage got polluted with the passage of time. The Vihangam (Bird) like moves began to disappear. Only Meen and Papeel methods remains. Papeel means an ant and Meen means a fish. Papeel Marg means to visit the Brahmand with the speed of an ant whereas Meen marg means to make upward and downward movements like a fish. There are 5 Methods of Mudras (postures). The first two kinds of Mudras are related to Papeel whereas the other 3 Mudras are related to Meen Marg. But it is only the Sants who adopt the Vihangam like movements.  
```text  
Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chaal Hamari  
```  
Sahib Kabir says that he adopts a Vihangam like movement. During his visit to the Brahmand, the devotee moves out of the body. He feels he is moving. It doesn’t appear dream like to him. But the movement is somewhat slow. He can see the 14 Lokas as well. This is not an ordinary thing. Nevertheless, the visit to Amarlok can’t be performed with one’s own effort. During the course of its travel, it appears as if someone else is moving along with. Mohammad Sahib says—  
```text  
Chala Jab Lok Ko, Shok Sub Teyagya,  
Hans Ka Roop Satguru Banai  
Keet Jyun Bhring Ko, Palat Bhringi Karey  
Aap Sung Rung Le, Le Udai  
```  
When the Satguru turned the Jiva into a Hansa, It left all sorts of identities and set forth on its journey to Sat Lok. This is just like the job of a Bhring that turns any larvae of insect like itself and helps it in flying.When such a situation arises, the devotee can see in all the ten directions.  
Wherever you fix your concentration, you feel yourself attracted to that very object. All this is due to the magnetic forces. But the devotee can’t talk to his Guru. On the other hand, in the Vihangam chaal-Path of Flight, the Disciple moves with the Satguru and also talks to him. The Satguru goes on narrating him about all the places they pass through. This journey depends on the will. Its speed can be decreased or increased at will. Normally this speed is, indeed, of a very rare kind. None can imagine it. The devotee moves while visiting all the ten places. When he reaches the end of the Brahmand, he loses his sense of discrimination. He finds himself powerless to move ahead. Beyond this none can go on the basis of his own power.  
That is why it is said—  
```text  
Ra-Rankar Khechri Mudra, Dasvan Dwar Thikana  
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Adi Ne, Ra-Rankar Ko Jana  
```  
Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh have a knowledge of Khechri Mudra (posture). This Mudra has its place in the 10th Dwara (aperture).  
None will tell you all these things. You can move  
out of your body as and when you desire.  
```text  
Koyi Koyi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Mein Dhar Maya Le Aayi  
```  
Remember! Though only some rare devotees reach  
Brahm Lok, yet the Maya, once again, pulls them back.  
When the devotee, moving at a fast speed, reaches the abode of Niranjan, he finds there the light equivalent to that of 4 crore Suns. This makes him forget himself. The Mind changes his position in a manner it does so in dreams. That is why all have said—  
```text  
Bey Antt... Bey Antt.  
```  
There are such kind of pleasures that one loses one’s sense of discrimination. That is why this abode is called as Jyoti Swaroop. One can find its mention everywhere. Here the Satguru absorbs the soul of the disciple within him and moves ahead.  
That body is transparent and the disciple is able to see each and everything. After crossing the Shunya, the Satguru separates the soul from him. The disciple asks the Satguru as to why he had absorbed him within him when they had travelled a great distance together. The Satguru says that that the power of Niranjan at that place is so strong that it could pull him back even though he was accompanying him. Niranjan would have influenced him.  
That is why he had absorbed him in himself.  
Clearly, one who says that the devotee can reach  
Amarlok based on one's own earnings is a big liar.  
Sahib Kabir says—  
```text  
Kitne Tapsi Tap Ker Darey, Kaya Dari Gara  
Grah Chhor Bhaye Sanyasi, Kou Na Pavat Para  
```  
Many a worshippers tried hard and even reduced  
their bodies to a skeleton. Many of them left their homes  
and hearths but still none of them could know these  
secrets. That is to say, they couldn’t have any knowledge  
of Amarlok. Sahib Kabir says—  
```text  
Ada Ker Khud Khazane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko  
```  
O Param Purush! Help your worshiper cross the  
worldly ocean.  
```text  
Na Kuchh Kiya Na Ker Saka, Na Kerne Yog Sharir  
Jo Kuchh Kiya So Sahib Kiya, Bheyya Kabir Kabir  
```  
Neither I have done anything nor is my body capable  
of any such thing. It is Sahib Kabir who has done all for  
me.  
Next comes the ocean of Surti. It is the ocean of that very concentration that has been working in our body. You must think that every job in the universe is being performed with the power of Surti alone and therein lies its ocean. The soul is made to take a bath there. It is only then that the Mind gets separate completely. It is not like diving in the water. It is the source of indescribable lights. Within a moment, it seems as if the Soul had emerged out of it some millions of spins. And when that soul comes before Param Purush, it gets in it the light of 16 suns. Then it becomes fully awakened.  
After this, whenever the Hansa has to visit there, the same procedure need not to be followed. The middle paths disappear. Just imagine the grace of the Satguru. Just think! Can such a thing happen on the basis of one’s own earnings. Certainly not, will be the answer.
