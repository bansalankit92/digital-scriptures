Study carefully the words I say. I say the thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in the Brahmand.  
This is because it belongs to the 4th Loka, also called as Amarlok. These simple words create unnecessary discussion.  
There are 5 kinds of ego.  
  
1. One related to strength.  
2. The 2nd one related to beauty.  
3. The 3rd one related to wealth.  
4. The 4th one related to Education.  
5. The 5th one related to Clan/caste/color/race.  
I am not an egotist. I visit the whole of India all alone. If I desire, I can have a body guard with me. I don’t decorate my body. I wear simple clothes. I mean to say, none can find in me any sign like that of an egotist. However, I say with a sense of full faith and confidence that the thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in the entire Brahmand.  
   Even if a poor person asks me to visit his house, I accompany him. I don’t let anyone massage my hands or feet. I move about like a Servent. If you judge my disciple closely, you will find them as rare ones from others. All this is due to the miracle of that thing.

   I see the same soul in all. So what is that I should boast of.  
   You may have more bones and muscles while someone else may have less. On seeing such a weak fellow you may abuse and frighten him in every possible manner. If we do so, it is nothing but an ego related to the bones and muscles. If we see the soul alone, we won’t feel any sense of ego.  
People boast of having unlimited wealth. When I have no money, what is that I should boast of. People say I have constructed so many Ashrams. I say none of these stands in my name. All these have been constructed out of the money contributed by the disciples.  
You care for bones and wealth but ignore the soul whereas we are concerned with the soul alone.

Sub Mein Atam Roop Pachhan  
```  
Try to see the soul in all.  
Even if I get control over whole of the world, I shall remain the same. Remember! It is only ignorance that gives birth to ego. So ego means ignorance. Earlier I used to hold satsang seating myself on the ground. I did so for 7 years. But the people had to stand up a bit to see me. As such, I got a Takhat Posh ( a wooden, table- like platform, used for sitting ) constructed for holding satsangs from there. The people began to decorate it. I didn’t allow them to keep even the flowers there. Some come with a garlands in hand but I refuse to accept it. In short, I live in complete simplicity. That which you take as ego is nothing but my self confidence and faith. That is truth and truth alone.  
Sometimes a shopkeeper says the chilies he is selling is of a special variety and is not to be found with other shopkeepers. He tells the place from where he has brought it. In the same manner, the thing I talk about is not to be found in this world. It is to be found in the 4th Loka alone .After getting it, a devotee achieves three things. I have tried the effect of this thing not on one or two but on Lakhs of devotees. There is no doubt about it. Three things that one achieves are—  
  
1. The Mind (Munn) and the Soul get separated.  
2. The attraction for the worldly objects begins to  
   fade.  
3. One attains a full security cover.  
Every Naami after getting blessed with Naam experiences changes within him.  
   Every one seems to be dancing to the tune of Mind. After all, Mind is very powerful. But such a thing has stopped happening with my Naamis. This is because after getting blessed with Naam, the devotee becomes awakened. The Naamis (Initiates) belonging to other Panths will be found to have no control over their Mind. They are found to be spiritually not awakened. My Naamis find the activities of these Naamis just like those of disturbed persons. This is because there is no guarantee as to when they will behave as a good or a bad person.  
   Secondly, my Naamis have control over their Mind. Their awakened soul enables them to understand the Mind. This is the most difficult job to perform. understanding the working of the Mind, the attraction for the worldly objects begins to fade. Thirdly, every Nami begins to feel the presence of an invisible power with him.  
   In such circumstances why Shouldn’t I say that the thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in the Brahmand. This thing enables the devotees to understand the true nature of their Soul.  
   Why do we sit in meditation? We do so to know our real identity. None in the world can separate his Mind from the Soul. The Mind has entangled the soul in such a manner that it has lost its power to understand anything. If the Mind expresses the desire to take food, the Soul also expresses the same desire. All the activities being performed by man keep him entangled more and more in the Mayaic net. Even after satisfying their earnest desire, man finds it hard to free himself from the grip of Mind.  
  
It is not easy to understand the games of Mind. It will give wealth and other miraculous powers to man but in no case it would allow him to escape from its clutches. It is only the Satguru who can help man in attaining freedom from its clutches and entanglements.  
Ignorance is the first power of Mind. The Mind has attaches itself on to the Soul in such a manner that the latter has lost the power to know its real identity. However hard one may try, one can’t cross the limit of Mind.  
A Satguru alone has the power to enable a devotee to know his Soul. Hansa has a wonderful property in its beak. It takes only milk and leaves the water, if any, part in it. None else can perform this wonder. Like the Hansa, the Satguru as well has the power in his concentration ( Paras Surati) through which he can separate the Mind from the Soul. He performs this job within a moment. After this the Mind can’t reattach on to the Soul.

Once the ghee is extracted from the milk, it is not possible to turn it back into milk. Likewise, if Butter is obtained by churning the Curd, it is not possible to turn it back into Curd.  
In the same manner, Mind can’t attach again to the  
Soul after Satguru separates it from the latter.

Guru Pall Mein Diya Pahunchae||  
```  
The Satguru enabled the disciple cover within a moment the path that couldn’t be covered even after taking countless births.  
When such a thing happens, the devotee feels a kind of comfort as one feels when some thorn in his foot is removed. After this the disciple won’t find it easy to feel the same kind of attraction for the worldly objects.

Naam Paye Satya Jo Beera, Sung Rahun Main Dass Kabira  
```  
  
Sahib Kabir says that he remains with the devotee  
who gets blessed with the true and real Naam.  
Take it as true that the world will repent after my departure from the world because there is truth and truth in my statement that ‘The thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in the Brahmand’.
