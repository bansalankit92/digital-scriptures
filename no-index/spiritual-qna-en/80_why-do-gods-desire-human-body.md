This is because all other Yonis except that of the human beings are called as Bhog Yonis. There one has only to reap the fruit of one’s Karmas. There is no scope for performing any new Karmas. The Gods reap the good fruit of their noble deeds. They can’t do any new Karma. However, it is man alone who, in addition to reaping the fruit of his Karmas, is at liberty to perform new Karmas as well. If he desires, he can attain heaven, Brahm Lok, Niranjan Lok or even the Amarlok. So to say, he can reach his original abode and attain Permanent Salvation. The Gods don’t get such an opportunity. That is why they desire to have the human birth.
