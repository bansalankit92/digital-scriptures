No, we are not against anything. We simply say that these musical notes are not Param Purush. We can speak only when two elements - Air and Earth - interact. You will feel a strange kind of echo in your ears if you press your teeth or hands tightly. It happens due to the activity of nerves.  
All this is related to the movement of our body. This will no longer remain as truth when the body gets destroyed. That is why we talk about Surti Yog and not about Surti Shabad Abhiyas.
