The Soul has been in the imprisonment of Niranjan since ages together. Niranjan has treacherously misled through the Mayaic net spread by him. Otherwise, neither Niranjan nor Maya have the power to catch hold of the Soul. So to say, the Soul itself has caught hold of the Maya.  
Niranjan could not do any harm to the Soul since ages together. It has remained as before. After getting blessed with Sajeevan Naam, the power of the Satguru also gets added to it. The Naam guards the soul as well as the body in which it is present. Then the reverse happens. It is Niranjan who begins to feel afraid. This is because he realizes that now onward he wonâ€™t be in a position to play with it.  
He makes all possible attempts to prevent Jiva from worshiping the Satguru and to remain engaged in his own worship as before. So you need not feel afraid in any way. He will oppose the Satguru through his own worshipers and will tease his followers in other ways. Therefore, the real fight is with Niranjan alone. It is the worshiper of the Satguru who emerges victorious in the long run. The devotee of the Satguru enters Amarlok stepping on the Niranjan's head.
