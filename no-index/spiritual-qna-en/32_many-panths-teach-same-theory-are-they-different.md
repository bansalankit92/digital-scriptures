Even a layman can read and recite the sayings of Sahib Kabir. He can even follow their teachings. There is nothing bad in it. However, the fact that remains to be seen whether he can reach his original abode Amarlok or not. In fact, Niranjan had requested Sahib Kabir to allow him to float 12 Panths in his name. That is why even though some talk about Sahib Kabir yet, inwardly, knowingly or unknowingly, they worship Niranjan. All this is due to ignorance on their part. Niranjan had asked for these Pants to simply to mislead Jivas so that only a small number of them can reach Amarlok.  
If Sahib or the Sant Satgurus so desire, they can take all the Jivas at once to Amarlok. Nevertheless, those who have love for the world, have not to be taken. After all, Niranjan is the son of Sahib. Niranjan had asked Sahib Kabir if all Jiva who worshiped Sahib could reach Amarlok, the world would becme uninhabited and barren. In that case he was also ready to go back to Amarlok. Otherwise, he should make the world barren or he should let him misled and entangle the Jivas. Sahib Kabir had accepted his request and this has been the main reason of misconceptions among the Jivas.

Dooidash Panth Kaal Permana  
Bhule Jeev Na Paye Thikana

The jivas misled by the 12 Panths of Kaal are at a  
loss to distingish the real path from false one.  
Therefore, it is important for the Jivas to assess whether the Naam they are going to be blessed with, is the Sajeevan Naam and soundless or is related to the Alphabat and has to be recited by mouth.
