There are 8 Chakras to be found in our body. However, the Yogis have a knowledge of the 7 Chakras alone. On the other hand, the Sants start their Journey from the 8th Chakra. Some take it as one and the same thing. There seems to be no logic in it.  
Mooladhar Chakra is the abode of Ganesh Ji, the navel region is the abode of Vishnu Ji whereas Anhad Chakra is the abode of Shiv Ji. He is the God of ego. In this very Chakra (Plexis) a devotee experiences the feeling of ‘I am’. Vishudh Chakra is the abode of Sarasvati.  
All the tunes emanate from here. Agya Chakra is the  
abode of Soul. The act of breathing takes place here.  
Sahastarsar is the 7th Chakra whereas the 8th Chakra is  
the abode of Satguru. But the Yogis remain confined to  
the 7th Chakra alone.

Aath Ataki Atari Manjhara, Dekha Purush Neyara  
Nirakar Aakar Na Jyoti, Nehin Vah Ved Vichara  
Ve Sahib Sub Sant Pukara, Aur Pakhand Hai Sara  
```  
In the abode of Param Purush there is nothing like Nirakar or Aakar. It is beyond the reach of the Vedas. The Sants have called Sahib as the only reality whereas everything else are described as unreal and falsehood.  
The Sants have talked of the 8th Chakra as well as of the 9th that is a hidden. When the Yogis have knowledge of the seven Chakras alone, how can we take it as one and the same thing? Reaching the 7th Chakra, the devotee attains the Vigyan dehi. They don’t say anything about the 8th Chakra.

Khaskhas Ke Daney Ke Under, Shehar Khuda Ka Basta Hai.  
Per Bin Mehar Murshid Ke Tu, Nahak Mein Hi Pachta Hai.  
```  
The whole of the city of Param Purush lies within a  
small grain of Khaskhas (a plant) but it is only the real  
Satguru who can take you there.
