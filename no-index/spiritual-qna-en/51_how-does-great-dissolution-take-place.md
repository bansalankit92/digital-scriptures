The elemental destruction of the earth is called as dissolution. The sun, the moon and the stars don’t get perished. However, when the great dissolution takes place, not only the earth gets perished but all the planets come near each other. Sometimes the Sun will appear at night at 12 o’clock. The planets will start moving in the reverse direction and will even go out of control. As a result, they will start colliding with each other. Great explosions will take place in the solar system due to the collision of the planets at terrible speed of Lakhs of Kilometers per second.  
The earth will experience great jerks. As a result of it, the water waves will rise up to a height of 100 Km. Water and water alone will appear all around. The water will destroy the earth. Earth is made of water and will get absorbed in it. Then the Sun will destroy the water. The air will put an end to the power of the Sun. It will happen in a manner a lamp gets extinguished when blown out. After this, the sky will absorb the air in itself. When a house gets destroyed, some rubbish is left behind but when the world gets destroyed, not even a pin is left behind. It is Nirakar God alone that is left behind. He , once again, creates the universe. This is the Nirakar God. The Vedas as well talk about it.
